Mediocre ideas, showing up, and persistence.

I don’t have much advice to give, but if I have any, it’s that little recipe. 

Truly great ideas are rare. Jokers like us will probably never have one. That’s OK. We have mediocre ones
all the time and they work just fine. I once had an idea to start a blog about CSS. I sucked at writing. I
sucked at designing. The vibe at the time was that everything important about CSS had already been written.
Nobody told me.

I didn’t just have the idea, I did it. That’s the showing up part. Hands on the keyboard, go. I barely
knew what I was doing. I stumbled through even following simple walkthroughs on how to install the software.
Executing your ideas is never overly comfortable.

Then never stop. Don’t get distracted by some other idea and prance away to that tomorrow. Keep doing it
until you’ve done everything you set out to do and everyone and their mom knows it. I didn’t stop blogging
when barely anyone read it for years. I didn’t stop when people told me I was dumb or wrong. I didn’t stop
when redesigns were met with vitriol. I didn’t stop when faced with mountainous challenges like inexplicable
server failure, legal trouble, and theft of the site itself.

Oh, plus, try not to be a dick. I’m convinced that helps.
