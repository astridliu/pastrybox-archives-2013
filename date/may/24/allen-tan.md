Form-making gets a lot of attention today.

The new forms are what people talk about. They win awards, clients, the praise of your peers, and money. They
start to get reused, adapted, and become a shorthand for kinds of storytelling. Our collective attention
privileges the *thing*.

But it’s worth remembering that they’re the substrate of a process. What you see rests on experiments with
framing word and image in certain ways, dividing and managing readers’ attention and rhythm and flow, and a
whole mess of technological superglue that bonds them together.

More often than not, it’s the form that gets copied, not the process that it came from. Maybe it’s because
it’s easier to copy the *thing*. But to mimic something without understanding why it works is to become a
[cargo cult](http://www.smithsonianmag.com/people-places/john.html), unlikely to reap the benefits you’re
hoping for.

The *thing* doesn’t matter. It — along with the assumptions, gambles, and affordances inherent — is
simply a stake in the ground. 

*This* worked *here*. 

It allows the [adjacent possible](http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/28/the-adjacent-possible/), the
next set of forms, to be uncovered.

Maybe it’s also because the thinking behind form-making is hard to decipher, and that we’re rarely
comfortable with talking about this stuff. Not in the open, anyway, and not nearly enough.
