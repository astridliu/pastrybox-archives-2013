Prototyping is a fundamental part of our approach. From quick, self-contained one-offs to more complex
interactions, we’ve embraced the process, elevating it from what many have considered a nicety to a
necessity. A prototype’s value is in communicating the intended idea over code reuse and pixel perfection.
Each project is different as are its requirements, and these variances mean we don’t adopt one systematic
way to do prototyping. In evaluating the needs of the projects, often we find ourselves prototyping to answer
questions that we can’t immediately answer. Can we do this? How would this work? These questions often pop
up early in the discussion or creative process – so the need to answer them should be just as timely. Is our
basket big enough for all those eggs we want to put in it?
