It was a glass box. A house in deep woods. It was remote. It was designerly on the interior, animaled on the
exterior. It was mine—for a summer. It was two summers ago, and it was intended for critical project
studies. “I’m spending the summer upstate,” I would say, as some New Yorkers do. “To write. To play
music.” “Where, again?” they would repeat, not being familiar with this particular breed of remote.
They’d tick off train stations as I shook my head. No, this was not those. No, this was a remote summer
alone from the city, designed to “Make Projects.” And off I went, trailing instruments and sewing devices
and writing material and dog. Yet sixty days later, I was back in the city. And just like that, it was
over.

__The remote remote__What people who make things know is that ideas fold you in a remote space—inside a
cabin, at a writer’s corral, inside your head, at a coffee shop—then ideas press you back out into the
world, rubbing your eyes on your behalf. To have an idea is to, at some point, retreat into quietude. With you
is the material of the world, the people, their exchanges, the sound of footsteps, the thing people do when
they get together, their life sounds. You fold those into your pocket as you fold yourself into your space.
And the making begins.

The road leading to the summer house was windy, punctuated with weathered signs. “National Scenic Bypass,”
you could make out, barely, on the days it wasn’t raining. The signs, proud proclamations once, were
threadbare from weather, as this particular bypass of beautiful that I had chosen to live on was cursed with
weather. The deep-mountain woods kind.

Expansive river views, long motorcycle roads, sunsets and rises, farmers’ markets, endless woods—these
quickly lose their charm when it rains. Particularly for weeks at a time. Satellite internet, too, loses its
certain magical property once rain and storms come. Power too goes down. So many days, I would sit, “making
projects,” with neither power nor internet. 

__Making projects__Within a week, the project became just surviving. “Light!” That was a project.
“Survived my first tornado...” “Rattlesnake!” These “challenges,” though, as challenging as they
were, may not have stood between my creative project-making so distinctly if I had been listening.

Rebecca Solnit:

“To hear is to let the sound wander all the way through the labyrinth of your ear; to listen is to travel
the other way to meet it. It’s not passive but active, this listening. It’s as though you retell each
story, translate it into the language particular to you, fit it into your cosmology so you can understand and
respond, and thereby it becomes part of you. The word __empathy__ originally meant feeling into, and to
__empathize__ is to reach out to meet the data that comes through the labyrinths of the senses. To enter into,
we say, as though another person’s life was also a place you could travel to.” [1](#fn1)

Rather than listening to the city, I left it. I didn’t meet the urban data halfway, making it part of me,
but packed it up and moved its shells upstate. As it turns out, my material is urban. It’s loud, and it’s
messy. It has feet and wheels and voices and opinions. It’s anti-pastoral. And without it, I have nothing to
create against.

Ideas need material to draw upon first, and a place to draw them out second. And to take hold, ideas, like
people, need a home.
