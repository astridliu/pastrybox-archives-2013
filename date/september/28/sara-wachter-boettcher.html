       <p>A few days ago, I had the chance to attend the <a href="http://2013.dareconf.com/">Dare Conference</a>—a conference about people skills for digital workers. A conference filled with personal stories and intensity and honesty and love. A conference as unexpected as it was necessary.</p><p>A conference I won’t soon forget. </p><p>My talk was about realizing that, no matter how deep my knowledge is— no matter how good I am at identifying problems for clients and colleagues, no matter what my practical skills are—I can’t actually fix things for other people. My work doesn’t stand alone; it rises and falls with others’ capabilities, with others’ interests in living out the ideas and recommendations and systems and structures I’ve spent so long defining. This topic has been bubbling up <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-june-10-2/">quite</a> <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-july-11/">a few</a> <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-august-27/">times</a> for me recently—but this time, it felt more raw. It felt like I’d put more of me onstage than ever before. You can watch it in full here (I get started at the 7:00 mark): </p><iframe src="http://new.livestream.com/accounts/2756751/events/2415381/videos/30818751/player?width=560&height=315&autoPlay=false&mute=false" width="560" height=315" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe><p>Maybe it was the context that made it different, gave me that sense of urgency. At Dare, I heard stories about people struggling with depression, and what that’s meant for their work. People who’ve fought off impostor syndrome, and want to help others do the same. People who were terrified of change in their organizations, but found the courage to embrace it anyway—and are having the career of their lives because of it. Many of these talks were extremely personal. All of them were thoughtful. Several of them made me cry.</p><p>Why have a conference about feelings, though? How will a good cry help us as professionals?</p><p>These are questions my friend <a href="http://lucidplot.com/">Jonathan Kahn</a>, who organized Dare, got a lot leading up to the event. It’s tough to get bosses to approve budgets for feelings, but after attending Dare, it’s clear that a few more should have.</p><p>Because the people we work with are human. They’re messy. And, more often than we want to admit, they’re struggling. They carry that with them, every day, as they sit across from you in meetings and obsess over design decisions and gossip at coffee and analyze research and do all the other tasks that make up our workdays.</p><p>You could say those messy feelings aren’t relevant to work, that their struggles are personal problems. But the thing is, our jobs are changing quickly. Keeping up with digital change means we can’t rely on rote job descriptions and checklists anymore. We need to be able to adapt, constantly. And adapting requires taking risks and collaborating with one another.</p><p>But taking risks and collaborating don’t happen by themselves. They require openness and vulnerability. And openness and vulnerability? They require trust.</p><p>Trust comes when we feel valued, understood, and important. It comes when we feel like we’re appreciated and embraced as whole people. And when we feel stifled, feel like we can’t be ourselves on the job, feel afraid of having emotions? We retreat to what we know. We don’t take risks, that’s for damn sure. We can’t embrace the changes organizations need us to to transform their businesses.</p><p>When we’re stuck, our organizations stay stuck, too. </p><p>Dare felt like a chance to get unstuck. A chance to admit that our work and our feelings go hand in hand. A chance to help one another start pushing our organizations and clients to more honest, wholehearted places. Places more of us could stand to reach. </p><p>So when you have a few minutes, <a href="http://new.livestream.com/dareconf/london-2013/">watch these talks</a>. They’re not practical—not in the way that case studies and action plans and technical walkthroughs might be. They’ll make you feel. But then, they’ll make you think. They’ll make you look at your work, and your coworkers, a little differently.  </p><p>If you’re anything like me, I think they’ll stick with you.</p>
