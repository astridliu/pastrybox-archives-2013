I was really hoping that ridiculous job titles in our industry were on the way out. You know, things like
“Web Weaving Wizard with a Black Belt in Social Media Kung-Fu.” But sadly, I was wrong.

Call me a party pooper, but I’m tired of how immature it sounds—this stuff isn’t actually magic. 

Can you imagine other well-respected professionals adopting these types of job titles?

Why not visit a Surgery Superhero to save you from that tumor? 

Is that ice cream just a little too sensitive? You could always check in at the Tooth Fairy. 

Are you suffering from that funny burning sensation when you pee? Best make an appointment with a Genital
Guru! 

Ray-Bans going out of style? Your neighbourhood Vision Magician will be sure to outfit you in the hippest new
specs.

If none of the above will solve your needs, you could see a Computer Necromancer, Artisanal Accountant, Hair
Architect, Tax Deity, or Customer Service Craftsman. Or maybe a Radiology Rockstar, Photo Conjuror, Insurance
Artist, Word Processing Warrior, or Import/Export Idol.

Enough said (I hope).

If we expect our clients to respect us and treat us like real professionals, let’s respect ourselves
first.

So, tell me again, what do you do?
