When a conquering general returned to ancient Rome, he could request a special ceremony from the state to
publicly honor his achievements. If the Senate voted to award this honor, called a triumph, the general would
be carried through the streets of Rome in a lavish procession with his army and all his captives and spoils of
his successful campaign on display. 

On the day of the triumph, the general himself wore a laurel crown and a toga lined with purple and gold, all
signifying his near-divinity. He would paint his face red, the color of Jupiter, the supreme god of the Roman
pantheon. But while the general sat in his chariot clothed in symbols of the gods, a slave walked beside him
and from time to time whispered in his ear “memento mori.” Remember, you are mortal.

Traditionally, triumphs were exceptionally rare events, granted only for the greatest victories. But towards
the end of the Roman republic, a series of lengthy wars produced a surge of triumphs, with each general
competing to outdo — and outspend — his predecessors. Pompey the Great was granted an unprecedented three
triumphs in his lifetime, the first when he was only 24, each one more lavish than the last. In his second
triumph, after a conquest in Africa, his chariot was pulled by elephants. In his third, he sprung for a second
day and a giant bust of himself covered in pearls.

Sometimes when I see a new wave of funding announcements or a PR cycle touting the latest startup milestones,
I imagine a postscript tacked on to the end of every one: *memento mori*.
