       <h1>For the new graduates, but also for the rest of us:</strong></h1><p>Learning about imposter syndrome is comforting, at first.</p><p>Everyone seems to have it, and when anyone talks about feeling lost, the first reassurance seems to be: <em>It’s ok! So do I!</em></p><p>If someone you admire, who is highly competent, can feel like a fraud or simply lucky, then you’re fine. Whew. You’re just the same as them! (And maybe you’re just as talented as they are, too.)</p><p>But I think it’s dangerous to tell that to people, despite how tempting it is to believe. Because the feelings that come from actual incompetence and the feelings that come from just being blind to your talent — well, it’s hard to tell them apart. From your limited perspective, it may be impossible. And if they’re actually incompetent, telling them that nothing’s wrong and to ignore their disquiet is the worst mistake to make.</p><p>Instead, perhaps consider:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Identifying blind spots.</strong> Is there anything obvious and foundational that is missing? Gaps in knowledge can be papered over or avoided for a while, but they should be identified first, before they can be slowly reinforced.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reminding them what they already know.</strong> It’s common, when feeling clueless, to imagine everything you know to be just a subset of what everyone else knows (or should know). But that’s not how knowledge works: it’s not one large pool, but many scattered puddles of varying sizes. The more related two bodies of knowledge are, the more adjacent the puddles will be. It may be valuable to bridge puddles together, to let them mix and feed into one another. And if a blind spot has been identified, reaching it by connecting what you already know will be easier and more interesting than starting from scratch.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seeing if there’s a mismatch between taste and skill.</strong> This <a href="http://kottke.org/11/04/your-taste-is-why-your-own-work-disappoints-you">Ira Glass quote</a> is well-known: but it cuts both ways. Just as your skill may not yet meet your high standards, you may also be quite skilled but not have developed taste — not having a strong enough sense of what’s great and what can be dropped. If one far exceeds the other, it’s time to work on bolstering what’s fallen short.</p></li><li><p><strong>Guiding them towards doing the above by themselves.</strong> This is the hardest one. But they’re not always going to have someone else they trust and knows them better than themselves. It’ll require being honest and vulnerable, and will feel like digging around in an open wound. It’s not pleasant, but it’s necessary.</p></li></ul>
