We have a few simple rules that guide our culture, one of them is: Partner with your client. Close
collaboration with our client partners from the very start of a relationship gives the team a deep
understanding of the problem space of a new project. When getting to know our new partners we take time to
audit business needs, existing resources, competitive landscape, and also the people — to understand the
day-to-day human-powered side of their business. This, after all, will be what delivers on the digital product
we all produce together.
