I lost my iPad on a flight and I’m currently stuck in a region of Italy with barely any wireless
connectivity (and let’s not even talk about getting 3G reception or even being able to purchase a SIM card
to begin with). The wireless hotspots I can connect to are so slow that most websites are unusable, so dealing
with reporting lost items and filling out forms is not exactly a quick or simple activity. If you think the
size of websites doesn’t matter because everyone has a good connection these days, think again. Even in a
modern country like this one, proper internet access is a privilege. Don’t assume otherwise.
