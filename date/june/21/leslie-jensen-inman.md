I was 20 when I lost my sister. She was 38. I don’t mean I lost her in a crowd, I mean she died. She died
from Leukemia. Cancer—a word no one wants to hear, let alone experience.

I found my mom when she was 36-1/2. That’s how old she was when she gave birth to me. Birth—a word that
brings hope, that brings new life. 

Late 30’s. I grow closer and closer to being in my late 30’s. The age where these life-changing events
took place for my sister and my mom. 

I struggle—I struggle with the feeling that time can be so limiting. And yet…so expansive. I struggle with
the idea that maybe my late 30’s is when all things end *and* at the same time I struggle with thoughts that
maybe my late 30’s is when a new chapter begins. *I struggle with time.* I struggle with my family’s past
and how it will play into my future. 

Sometimes, I think about the effect of my sister’s death. It has been profound and long-lasting. I wonder if
some of my passion to get meaningful things accomplished *and* accomplished quickly comes from knowing that my
time is limited. Not as in, I have-too-much-to-do in a single day kind of limited, but that I am mortal and my
time is not infinite. 

So, what to do with my limited time? 

That becomes the question—the very essence of my existence. It’s the question I challenge myself with
everyday. Each day, I wake up and ask myself: How will I make awesomeness today? How will I do good today? And
every night, I go to bed asking myself how did I make awesomeness today? How did I do good today? 

I use the word “awesomeness” frequently, but to me, it’s more than just a word to describe something
that’s “cool.” Awesomeness is the quality of being an awesome human being. But how can we possess the
quality of being awesome and really what does that even mean? In many ways, this is a personal question with
an even more personal answer. 

Being awesome means: inspiring wonder. Each of us has the opportunity and the responsibility to inspire wonder
in the world. Why? Because each of us adds to the outcome of the world that we touch and thus, we create.
Inspiring wonder, making awesomeness—this seems like a pretty hefty responsibility and sometimes it can be.
Fortunately, for all of us, small acts of kindness can help to instill a sense of wonder within our world. We
just have to commit to making awesomeness by focusing on doing good. 

How will I make awesomeness today? How will I do good today? How did I make awesomeness today? How did I do
good today? These questions keep me balanced. I want to do amazing things, but I want these amazing things to
go beyond me. I want to help our industry, our community, and our world. I know *I don’t know* how long I
will have here, on this earth, so I must give what I can, as I can. It’s something I feel deep within
myself. I know when I give to others I am spending my finite time in positive ways and by doing so, I’m
actually growing time. By sharing my time with others, it multiplies and grows exponentially. 

It’s like being the ultimate Time Lord and my vessel—myself—is the ideal Tardis. When I step into the
story of myself, it suddenly is bigger on the inside than it is on the outside. That’s what I need it to be.
I need to be happy with my own story and understand that no one will really understand the depth or scope of
it. And that’s okay. It may always look smaller from the outside—even when I’m the one standing on the
outside of my own life and have momentarily lost perspective of the infiniteness of my own possibilities. 

Sometimes by helping others, the effect is immediate and easy to see. Other times, I know that I am a stone in
a pond and the ripples of goodness I share travel beyond the horizon I see. And maybe that’s the point of it
all—for us to be stones in the ponds of life. To share with others. To support others. To laugh and cry with
others. To connect with others. *And* that we connect in such profound ways that the ripples we start are
continued infinitely throughout time and reach others in ways we may never experience firsthand. To make
awesomeness and do good and hope that we have spent our limited time here, on this earth, in the most
productive ways we can. 

We can make awesomeness and do good in many ways—through our professional lives and through our personal
lives. Here’s the thing: Many of us have come to realize that there is no such thing as life-work balance
that there’s *only* life-life balance and with this realization comes the knowledge that it takes us making
awesomeness and doing good in *both* our professional and personal lives. 

So the challenge I pose to all of us is to make awesomeness and do good. To be the ripples in life’s
pond—to give beyond what we can see as immediate goodness. To be open and brave. To share and connect. To
embrace *and* grow time. To be present in each and every moment in our lives.

Let’s do this for our industry, our community, and our world. Let’s do this for ourselves. Let’s not let
time define us, but instead let’s define our time.
