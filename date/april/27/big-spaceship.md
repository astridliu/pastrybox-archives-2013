You spend most of your time at work, so we think you have to make it a fun place to be. It’s easy for people
to burn out in this type of field, so we think creating a great atmosphere around here is really, really
important. We decided to organize people in teams rather than by discipline, and the difference has been night
and day. Each team has its own bank of desks and chooses its own team name and logo, and creates a sense of
identity.
