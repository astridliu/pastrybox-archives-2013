       <p>People ask me all the time how they can get started in content strategy: <em>How do I convince my boss to let me do more? How do I go beyond being a writer or a content manager? How do I wrap my head around content as systems and sites get massive and messy?</em> </p><p>Usually I end up tossing something out about asking tough questions and poking your nose where you don&#8217;t belong until people start incorporating you in their projects. </p><p>That&#8217;s not a lie, but it is a bit of a cop-out. Because I believe the real answer starts not in what you <em>do</em>, but in how you <em>think</em>. </p><p>The people who are best at strategic work—actually, scratch that, the people who are the best at practically <em>anything</em> —share a common trait: the ability to hold big ideas and minute details together in their heads at the same time—and to constantly, naturally, be vetting one against the other.</p><p>They can come up with a concept, then immediately find its weaknesses and figure out its feasibility. They can look at a bevy of tiny details and see which of them are actually important to the big picture—and which aren&#8217;t worth sweating. They understand that minutia like microcopy and QA matter, but they don&#8217;t get stuck on them so long the rest of the project suffers. They&#8217;ll dream up a cool way to personalize an experience, then immediately ask whether they have the data and logic to actually deliver it. </p><p>I&#8217;ve seen too many projects fail because the people with the &#8220;big ideas&#8221; didn&#8217;t see it as their job to care about the small stuff, too. And, just as detrimental, I&#8217;ve seen too many people waste their time and skill sets by getting so hung up on formatting a laundry list of content recommendations that they can&#8217;t see the bigger themes and opportunities. </p><p>Vision is lovely, but vision alone doesn&#8217;t ship. It&#8217;s the people who can carry vision through—and not just by handing off a plan or drawing a diagram, but by actually working through the challenges of execution—who are most valuable. </p><p>And boy could the world sure use more of them. </p>
