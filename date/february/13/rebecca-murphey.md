We programmers like our if/else statements: If this is true, then do this; otherwise, do this. Indeed, I think
part of what I like about programming is that it makes it seem possible to express complex processes as a set
of rules.

This tidy approach fails us, though, when we can’t express a decision in terms of a series of booleans
that, when ANDed and ORed appropriately, lead us to the Right Decision. Backbone or Ember? SASS or plain CSS?
Rails or Node? Progressively enhance or HTML that’s nothing but some scripts and an empty `<body>`
tag? False dichotomies, every one of them, and plenty more that you’ll see argued to death with facts
and figures and passion.

Rarely are real-world decisions as straightforward as a simple if/else statement. Details, nuances,
constraints… they all matter. The ability to see the big picture, to understand that there is no One
True Way, and to use the judgment that comes with experience — that’s what makes for a truly good
developer.
