For the last couple of years, I’ve traveled too much. Granted, I was on the road much less than many of my
colleagues, who live mostly in airports and hotels and on intercontinental flights. But for me? Too much. I
got to too much by saying yes to a ton of interesting things—client work, conferences,
*un*conferences—that made my work life richer and more interesting. But the cost was a sense of constant
fragmentation: the feeling that I was always preparing for a trip, or on a trip, or scrambling to catch up
after returning. I love exploration, but my ability to think clearly and stay healthy depends on long
stretches at home, where I can browse my own bookcases and cook my own food and enjoy my cat and neighborhood
and local friends.

Just because I *can* squash 20 work trips into a calendar year or work full-time plus three crunchy side-gigs
doesn’t mean I can do it endlessly or without damaging my capacity for creative work, synthesis, and other
things that require a rested, resilient brain. So when I can, I’m going to try to build a schedule that
works less like a merry-go-round and more like a [vivarium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivarium): something
quieter and a bit more protective of my energy, my time, and the projects I’m already committed to. And that
will mean saying no to even the most enticing new opportunities when I know they’ll send me off course in
ways that take days or weeks to repair. It’s not an easy thing for me to do—I’ve been an overscheduler
since grade school—but the rewards of doing a bit less are too important to ignore.
