Lately I’ve been wondering what is next for web conferences and events. More specifically: what events
will get created that engage the talented people in the intermediate to advanced range?

Since attending my first [FOWD](http://futureofwebdesign.com/landing-page) in 2009, I’ve noticed serious
growth in the number of available events. In the U.S. and the U.K., you can attend a high-quality event every
month.

There are many events that are a mix of beginner-to-intermediate topics and some events where topics lean
towards the thought leaders. While everyone can benefit from the camaraderie and inspiration that comes from
attending any of these, many reach a level where only a couple of presentations at an event teach them
something new.

During this growth period in skill development, the bulk of learning is done hands-on (preferably working with
people who have more advanced and varied skills). I’d love to see some events pop up that are focused on
this group.

I’m thinking that they would take pieces from conferences, workshops, hackathons and competitions like
the [Rails Rumble](http://railsrumble.com). There would need to be discussion, coordination and a goal for
creating something. Let’s figure out a way to get groups of people together to share knowledge and
create awesome.
