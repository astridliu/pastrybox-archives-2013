       <p><cite>The Andy Griffith Show</cite> ran from 1960-1968. Quite a bit &#8220;before my time,&#8221; but plentiful reruns allowed me to become a big fan.</p><p>I don&#8217;t like the show for its humor. It has some, but it&#8217;s pretty hokey and outdated. I don&#8217;t like the show for its stories. It&#8217;s just a sitcom with contrived little occurrences that always resolve themselves like any other sitcom. I like the show because it&#8217;s a masterclass in How To Be A Man.</p><p>Andy always treats people with respect, whether they deserve it or not. Even the town drunk, Otis, isn&#8217;t reviled and is given a chance when he needs one. And not just respect, but concern and fairness.</p><p>Andy almost never carries a gun. He doesn&#8217;t need one to control situations. He could defuse problems with a firm voice and presence.</p><p>Andy rarely loses his temper. And when he does he always apologizes for it.</p><p>Andy was smart. He often got to the bottom of things before anyone else.</p><p>Andy knew how to have fun and relax. He was the sheriff and a serious man, but he went camping, fishing, out on dates, and often played the guitar.</p><p>Yep, he&#8217;s a fictional character. Shouldn&#8217;t we have real people as role models? Sure, and I do. But just as a schoolyard kid might think of Batman to summon courage to stand up to a bully on the playground, I too sometimes think of ol&#8217; Andy Taylor when I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to react to something. At the risk of beating an overused phrase into the ground even more, I often think to myself: What Would Andy Taylor Do? I think if I did it even more I&#8217;d be a better person.</p><p class="footnote">Just for fun: did you know the theme song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2Myd0fY1PA">had words</a>?</p>
