       <p>I’m in the last few days of a medium-sized project. It’s gone over time by a couple of months. And, even with the extra time, we’re scrambling like mad to get the important parts complete and to make sure the duct tape is going to hold.</p><p>I’m juggling a lot of stuff on top of this one project, so I have lots of solid excuses why we’re late. Other concurrent projects fragmented my time and unforeseen, unrelated tasks popped up out of nowhere. On this project, one user study taught us some hard lessons that took time to change. And, we had difficulty with an outside resource that set us back a bit. We’re also our own worst critics, so we tinkered and edited a bit more than was strictly necessary.</p><p>This whole experience has rudely reminded me how difficult it is to ship. I remember a conversation from about five years ago with Dave Morin (founder of Path) when he was still at Facebook. Dave and I were talking about what makes a great designer at Facebook and he clearly stated that the truly valuable designers are designers who can ship products.</p><p>We had both seen plenty of designers who could brainstorm, sketch seemingly great ideas, and create lovely comps in Photoshop. We had spent time with a heaping of designers who could talk a good game about typography, Swiss grids, and color theory. But a surprising number of those same designers struggled to tie off loose ends and ship products.</p><p>In the end (as I am again bearing witness to) it’s really difficult to ship a coherent product. Shipping requires a messy combination of pragmatism, perfectionism, politicking, time management, coordination, and sometimes pure blood, sweat, and tears.</p><p>In the end, I can pile up all of the excuses in the world but we’re still finishing a bit late. There continues to be plenty to learn in the art of shipping.</p>
