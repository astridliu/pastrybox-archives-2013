I’ve spent the better part of the past couple of years traveling as much as I’ve been home. TripIt tells
me I’m in first place among my friends for number of days on the road—a dubious honor.

I know a few things about how to live out of a suitcase. These tips aren’t aimed at the minimalist,
around-the-world-with-one-small-backpack crowd. But if you have to go to a conference or on a business trip,
here’s what I’ve learned the hard way.

 *  Roll your clothes

If I teach you one thing it’s that you can pack more into a suitcase if you roll your clothes into
cylinders, as compared to folding them. It’s also easier to find what you’re looking for with everything
in neat rows. If you like this idea but think it’s not cult-like enough, then [packing
cubes](https://www.google.com/search?q=packing+cubes) are the product for you. I’ve never tried them but I
assure you that everyone who *has* tried them told me all about them, repeatedly.

 *  Keep your toiletry kit ready to go

I’d lose my mind if I had to remember to bring toothpaste every time I packed. Just keep duplicates of
everything you need to bring stored in some kind of travel case.

 *  The “I have first-world problems” toothbrush holder

One problem with keeping all my toiletries stored in a kit is my toothbrush would get kind of gross. This
[toothbrush
holder](http://www.amazon.com/Verilux-CleanWave-Portable-Toothbrush-Sanitizer/dp/B002HJ3XU6/ref=sr_1_1) costs
$20 and requires batteries. It bathes the head of my toothbrush in a healing blue light, rapturing the germs
and leaving it as pure as the day I bought it. It is, hands down, the most ridiculous product I own. I love
it. 

 *  Buy one good suitcase and use it

I see these poor people at the airport, rolling these rickety contraptions with cheap handles and wobbly
wheels. If you’re going to live out of a suitcase, you need a good one. Buy a rolling suitcase that will fit
in the overhead compartment. And that’s the only one you need. One day trip? Use your suitcase. Three week
trip through several different climates? Use the same suitcase. (And don’t ever check it. Checking is for
suckers.)

 *  Limit your shoes

You will never be able to make it for three weeks out of the same carryon suitcase if you bring all your
shoes. Two pairs is ideal, three pairs if you must. May I suggest leaving your running shoes behind? 

 *  The “I wish Obama really were a socialist” water boiler

Visiting my friends in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, I’m envious of government policies that offer
health care, public transportation, affordable childcare, and marriage equality. I also envy the tea kettles
in hotel rooms. American hotel rooms provide a cheap drip coffee maker, the instructions on which advise that
it can also be used to boil water for tea. This is an option useful only to the most hung-over of
conference-goers who are willing to drink vaguely coffee-flavored tea (NB: I have done this.) This [nifty
gadget](http://www.amazon.com/NORPRO-559-Immersion-Warming-Liquids/dp/B000I8VE68/ref=sr_1_1) immerses in a cup
of water and makes it boil. Bring your own tea bags and lounge in bed while everyone else stumbles down to
Starbucks in the morning.

 *  Unpack

Don’t live out of a suitcase. If you’re going to be in a hotel room longer than a night, hang things up or
put them away in drawers. I find that pretending I don’t live out of a suitcase doesn’t take any longer
when it comes time to repack. And it helps keep me sane.

I’m done with living out of a suitcase for a while. Next year I look forward to writing another post, called
*How to live comfortably in your own home.*
