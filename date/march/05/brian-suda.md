Everyone keeps raving about interfaces where you wave your hands around all Minority Report style. I wonder if
we go down the road where that is the only way to interact with the system, we’ll have a limiting factor of
who can actually use the system. If you don’t have 2 arms, 2 legs and 10 fingers and toes, the system might
not work for you. At the moment, accessibility can be achieved through other devices. If a mouse is too hard
to use, then keyboard support would suffice, or aural input and output. How come you never seen someone in the
future in a wheelchair using these crazy new kinaesthetic interfaces?
