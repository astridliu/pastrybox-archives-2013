       <p>I always keep two books on my nightstand. Right now, I’m trundling through <cite>Anna Karenina</cite> (my first Tolstoy!) and rereading a 2011 issue of <cite>Lapham’s Quarterly</cite> titled <a href="http://www.laphamsquarterly.org/magazine/the-future.php">The Future</a>. It’s a way to make accidental juxtapositions and see connections that I wouldn’t have come up with on my own.</p><p>Timo Arnall recently wrote about <a href="http://www.elasticspace.com/2013/03/no-to-no-ui">the problems with ‘invisible design’</a>. It not only questions the myth of the intuitive, but also argues eloquently for the legible. (It doesn’t hurt that it draws upon lots of prior design literature, which we could all stand to do more of.) The piece got shared widely online and was met with surprise and controversy.</p><p>Now, here’s some juxtaposition (emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>It turns out that changing behaviour is a way to subsequently change attitudes; this is entirely counter the thinking behind many smart systems, which are predicated on feedback loops delivering information to people, whose attitudes then change, and who then choose to change their behaviour accordingly. Instead, behaviour change happens through changing behaviour, and then attitudes.</p><p><strong>It is not enough to simply “make the invisible, visible”, to use the already well-worn phrase in urban informatics.</strong> But change might happen through creating convenient, accessible ways to try something different, and then multiplying that through social proof and network effects, reinforcing through feedback. (This means all those smart meters are a complete waste of time and money, and will eventually have to be uninstalled.)</p></blockquote><p>That was from Dan Hill’s piece about <a href="http://www.cityofsound.com/blog/2013/02/on-the-smart-city-a-call-for-smart-citizens-instead.html">‘smart cities’ and active citizenship</a>. It takes Timo’s arguments for legibility and extrapolates it to more smartness—but guess what? Dan posted it <em>before</em> Timo’s piece. I was lucky to make the connection between them only because I’d read Dan’s entry a week prior.</p><p>This particular kind of serendipity—remembering and seeing connections between unrelated works—ignores many distinctions. It doesn’t matter whether something is new or old, whether it was published in the <cite>New Yorker</cite> or on a blog, whether it was written by a designer or scientist or urban planner. Your act of <em>reading</em>—jumping from point A to point B—creates a wormhole between the two. It lets you time travel.</p>
