When I was a child, I *really* liked Mister Rogers. Okay, I was a little obsessed.

I wasn’t so into Mr. R’s cardigans or the fact that he took off his shoes in front of me, in front of all
of us (ew!). Instead, I was fascinated by the fact that we didn’t just hang out with Mr. R, we visited his
entire neighborhood. We traveled beyond the land with the little puppet people to go on field trips to learn
how things were made.

The field trip I remember most fondly was the trip to a crayon factory. Through the magic of moving images I
was able to join him—we all were. We were able to see how crayons were made. And, it was awesome—truly
spectacular. I couldn’t get enough.

I was hooked on these fields trips. Hooked, because I was curious. I wanted to learn how things were made. Mr.
R took us into the factories we couldn’t go to as kids. Through these field trips, I learned how pieces fit
into a whole. I learned that it took people, machines, design, and technology all working together to make the
everyday items, like crayons, that I used.

I earned a respect for the people who worked on the manufacturing line. Their jobs looked challenging. Even
though they repeated the same task, over and over again, they approached their work with a sense of mastery
and professionalism that I could understand—even as a kid.

The workers were making—they were makers. Watching these makers turn hot liquid wax, hardening powder, and
pigment into one of my favorite things—crayons—taught me the importance of standards. I learned the
importance of professional standards and the importance of product standards. If something wasn’t made up to
a specific set of standards then it was pulled from the assembly line.

These field trips, this idea of searching for the answers of how things are made, have stayed with me my
entire life.

My first job out of college was at a design studio that had multiple printing presses on site. The studio had
a team of designers and a team of pressmen. I didn’t have lunch with the designers—I spent most of my days
with them already. Instead, I ate with the pressmen. They had all been working on printing presses for at
least 25 years and had a wealth of knowledge to share with a young designer. Because I was curious, they were
willing to share their knowledge with me.

I learned how to make my design work better by listening to them talk about the presses. After lunch, they
would bring me into the press room and show me how to take the blankets and plates off the press. They showed
me how the machines, that brought my designs to life, worked.

The pressmen showed me why hiccups and orange peeling—two things you really don’t want to happen to your
printed pieces—happened. And they showed me how to design in a way that helped avoid common printing
problems. They shared with me design decisions designers made that really ticked them off—things that made
the pressmen’s jobs harder and sometimes impossible. In essence, the pressmen showed me how to make my work
stronger. They showed me how to think beyond just being a designer and they helped me to design as a
maker.

They did this by encouraging my curiosity. They did this by sharing their experiences and their knowledge.

Sometimes, as designers, we forget that it often takes teams of people working together to help make our
products come to life. It takes people, machines, design, and technology all working together to make the
items we and other folks use. We all need to encourage the curiosity of learners. Learners of any age. If
someone is curious about learning how to make something, let’s take a little time and show them our process.
Let’s all be a little more like the pressmen and Mister Rogers. Let’s share the world of
making—cardigans optional.
