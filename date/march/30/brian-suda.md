There is a wealth of data locked up because existing government organisations are too scared to give it away
or their previous business model revolved around the scarcity of the data. Mapping and GPS are prefect
examples of information that once set free, multi-billion dollar business have sprung-up. The US is pretty
liberal in what they give away after it has been created with tax payers’ money. Other countries are not as
lucky. If you look at software to compute travel distances, route planning, address to lat/lon look-ups, these
work much better in the US than in Europe and other countries. It isn’t for lack to talent or skills, but
for the lack of open data.
