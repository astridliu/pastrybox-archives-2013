We exert a huge amount of time and resources to tailor experiences towards users. We try to understand and
empathize with them, but fail to simply make things work for entire groups of people.

Focus groups, card sorting, user testing, and ethnographic research are all ways to collect information in
order to tailor a design to the user. They can be used to understand people and the way they perceive and
interact with a product, physical or digital. A huge amount of importance has been placed on humans. This is
awesome (in both a philanthropic and business sense), but on the web, we aren’t always responsible.

Accessibility, or functionality for entire groups of people, is at the base of the [pyramid of
needs](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/04/26/designing-for-a-hierarchy-of-needs/). Delight created
through visuals or interactions, usable navigation, and good content all fail if the interface breaks, is
unnavigable, or doesn’t load. When something simply does not work due to the lack of [Progressive
Enhancement](http://alistapart.com/article/understandingprogressiveenhancement), we undermine the entire
pyramid.If something doesn’t work right, we get irked, complain about what a bad service it is and then
move on, potentially not returning to it later. If someone in a less fortunate part of the globe is trying to
visit an inaccessible site, he or she could incur costs for data or be unable to reach important information.
In their context, there’s no easy fix like changing a line of CSS or switching to the newest browser.

This post doesn’t address the power behind the open web or scold deadline pressured developers with clients
that don’t understand. It doesn’t argue for the value of accessibility from a business standpoint or talk
about [disabilities](http://a11yproject.com/posts/myth-accessibility-is-blind-people/). It doesn’t provide
massive amounts of data illustrating the [expansion of the
device-iverse](http://opensignal.com/reports/fragmentation-2013/) or mention pervasive computing on the
horizon.

Lets just think twice before skipping over responsibility and Progressive Enhancement in relation to UX/Human
Centered Design.
