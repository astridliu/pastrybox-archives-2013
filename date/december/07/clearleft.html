       <p>As we edge towards the finish line of 2013, it’s worth glancing over our shoulders to see where we’ve been, in the hope that it will provide some indication of where we may be heading next.</p><p>Responsive design was a big theme of 2013, with lots of companies producing frameworks that promised to make the process easier. Like the JavaScript libraries that came before them, they achieve this by setting boundaries, automating common tasks and providing a lot of useful functionality “for free”. This is great if your goal is to get something up and running quickly, but it can hide the mechanism underneath.</p><p>As such I worry that people are starting to rely on these abstractions a bit too much, while foregoing the fundamental knowledge that underpins them. This is especially true when you need to put in an exception and trawling through hundreds of lines of unused code doesn’t feel quite as “free” any more. I’m also worried about the number of companies settling on a library or framework before they’ve even started analysing the problem. It’s as though they are trying to fit the problem around the tool, rather than the other way round.</p><p>The strange thing with responsive design is that it isn’t actually that complicated, especially if you’ve been paying attention to liquid design, universal design and progressive enhancement over the last few years. Sure, there are a few annoyances like image sizing that require a bit of help, but a lot of responsive frameworks sit somewhere between laziness and overkill. This is one of the reasons we’re very specific about wanting to hire folks who are aware of the popular libraries and frameworks, but are able to work framework free.</p><p>Like all multi-tools, they promise flexibility but that flexibility often comes with hidden limitations and boundaries. So as with their JavaScript predecessors, I expect to see a bit of a backlash against responsive frameworks over the coming months.</p><p>On the plus side, I think the industry is getting much better at integrating responsive design into our daily practice, and this is having positive effects in other areas. For instance, Clearleft have always been a fairly collaborative bunch, but that level of collaboration has steadily risen over the last 3-4 years, as cross-functional paring became the norm.</p><p>The other big trend of 2013 has to be “flat design”. We can debate the merits of flat design or whether it counts as a movement indefinitely. However, it’s clear than many designers have eschewed metaphorical interfaces—thanks in part to Apple’s overutilization of skeuomorphism—in order to follow a more typographical heritage. The problem with this approach is that it does away with a lot of useful affordances, making discovery a lot more problematic. This is where kinetic design comes in.</p><p>For a start, subtle animation is a really efficient way of hinting how an interface works by showing what’s hidden, able to accept input or otherwise be interacted with. This is especially useful on small screen interfaces where real estate is tight and the chance of distraction is high. Animation is also a great way of communicating personality and character by simulating weight, friction or playfulness.</p><p>However it doesn’t stop there. We recently started experimenting with animation as a way of bringing static concepts to life in prototypes or during product presentations. Considering how simple this tool can be, we’ve found it surprisingly effective. In fact, it’s been so effective I’m kicking myself that we’ve never really explored it before.</p><p>At the moment we’re doing this mostly with CSS/JavaScript or Keynote, although some of our team have been playing with After Effects and Quartz Composer recently. I suspect animation is going to become a much more common tool in our toolkit over the next 12 months, as we being to gain competency—if not mastery—of the various packages.</p><p>As such, I think animation is going to become a much more talked about tool over the coming year, with UX agencies starting to adopt it into their daily practice as they did with sketching a number of years back. So it’s definitely worth exploring new tools like Quartz Composer, experimenting with existing tools like Keynote, and organising training session on traditional tools like After Effects. </p><p style="text-align: right"><a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">—Andy Budd</a></p>
