When I first started out as a designer, I was insecure about my taste. It seemed like a critical part of my
identity to know — immediately and decisively — what was good and what wasn’t. I felt like I needed to
build an impenetrable wall of judgement and very carefully monitor what passed through and what didn’t.
After a while, that behavior that started out of insecurity just turned into habit. I couldn’t turn it off.
I was the guy at a party who had an opinion about movies he’d never seen and books he’d never read.

As I got older, things happened in my life that broke some pretty big holes in my carefully constructed wall.
Once my defenses were weakened, things started streaming in all over the place — new experiences, emotions,
Fleetwood Mac albums. After my son was born, I would sometimes find myself tearing up just walking out of the
subway because the light was a certain way and some song I’d never even heard before was playing in my
headphones. It was weird, and unexpected, to be open to all these things I’d been so carefully unaffected by
before, but it wasn’t threatening. I was still me, just with less of a filter. Less discerning. And a little
happier?
