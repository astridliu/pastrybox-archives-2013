       <p>At the beginning of this year I hung a poster. A poster created four years ago that I finally got around to buying.</p><p>I hung it in my bedroom; it’s the first thing I see when I wake, and the last thing I see before I sleep.</p><p>Things this year have been especially challenging. I’ve hit many hurdles, as we all do—professional, emotional, and financial. Let’s just say it hasn’t been easy, so I’ve been very aware of the things and the people around me that have lightened my load and given me comfort.</p><p>This poster has most certainly been one of those. </p><p>I honestly believe that it’s helped motivate me. It’s picked me up, reminded me to stay passionate (or otherwise question what I’m doing), and above all it’s given me comfort and confidence in who I am.</p><blockquote style="font-style: normal"><p>This is your life. Do what you want and do it often. <br />If you don't like something, change it. <br />If you don't like your job, quit.<br />If you don't have enough time, stop watching TV.<br />If you are looking for the love of your life, stop; they will be waiting for you when you start doing things you love.<br />Stop over-analysing, life is simple.<br />All emotions are beautiful.<br />When you eat, appreciate every last bite.<br />Life is simple.<br />Open your heart, mind and arms to new things and people, we are united in our differences.<br />Ask the next person you see what their passion is and share your inspiring dream with them.<br />Travel often; getting lost will help you find yourself.<br />Some opportunities only come once, seize them.<br />Life is about the people you meet and the things you create with them, so go out and start creating.<br />Life is short, live your dream and share your passion.</p><p>© Holstee Inc.</p></blockquote><p>I’d strongly recommend that you <a href="http://shop.holstee.com/products/holstee-manifesto-poster">hang one of your own</a>. This is your life—it’s worth it. </p><p class="footnote">My genuine thanks and daily appreciation go to Dave, Mike, Fabian, and Rachel. </p>
