    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>Many people—perhaps even you, reading this—make their own physical products, usually with a website to market and sell them. These products are usually unique, original designs, supported and marketed entirely by independent individuals or companies; this is usually in a conscious bid to avoid needing large manufacturing processes, or middlemen diluting the quality of the original design. There are many of us creating truly beautiful products, and taking great care to ensure that quality spans from the ideas to their execution, from their packaging to their website.</p><p>A pattern I’ve spotted, however, is that the majority of us who do this usually do so on the side of our day job. This could be for any number of reasons, but the most common one is simply that sales from these avenues alone wouldn’t cover our required (or preferred) income.</p><p>A second notable issue is <em>audience</em>; we tend to sell online—to other designers and creatives in similar circles—often missing out on a much wider audience—the general public—that more cash-rich high-street brands can take advantage of far more easily. After all, having a physical presence in a city centre is bound to have a proportionally bigger impact than just being another one of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-many-web-sites-are-are-there-2012-3">over 640 million websites</a>!</p><p>Some third-party websites, such as <em><a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a></em> or <em><a href="http://eu.fab.com/">Fab</a></em>, have done a great deal to help mitigate some of these issues—and you can’t deny that they do a fantastic job of supporting independent designers and producers across the world—but I still feel like that one crucial piece of the puzzle is missing: a physical shop where people can <em>see</em> and actually <em>feel</em> the products, before they buy.</p><p>I want to help find that missing piece.</p><p>I want to offer support to all designers who sell quality products, helping them to receive more recognition, and, ultimately, make more money by taking them to a different, wider audience. Instead of selling online, to other designers, I want to take these designers’ products to the high street!</p><p>I’m extremely excited to announce that the summer of 2014 will bring with it <em><a href="https://whositandwhatsit.com/">Whosit & Whatsit</a></em> (W&W)—a boutique, <em>physical</em> shop selling independent designers’ products to the general public. It will play host to products for <em>yourself</em>—jewellery, clothing, books, publications, etc.—and those that span the full range of home and office living—furniture, prints, and accessories.</p><p>W&W’s focus is on fostering and nurturing the livelihood of the independent designer. This means that, naturally, there will be a lot of emphasis on quality and individuality but, more importantly, <em>accessibility</em>. I’m taking a more unusual approach with the shop in an attempt to keeps costs for the designer as low as possible: instead of the more traditional model of buying stock from a supplier and then marking it up to sell on at a profit, I’m working to a model whereby <em>you</em> set the prices, and <em>you</em> keep any profits. All W&W does is ask for a small monthly subscription fee to cover our costs of keeping the doors of a physical shop open, anything else made from the sale of the products goes straight back to the designers.</p><p>The service is offered via the way of a submission, meaning <em>everyone</em> is welcome to submit to sell through W&W (international and UK designers alike). Places are limited—due to the limitations that come with physical space, of course—however more places will become available at key points throughout the year(s) after opening.</p><p>Interestingly, due to the nature of this unconventional business model, there is another exciting avenue that W&W will be looking to head down. Because W&W’s aim is to take as little as possible from the independent suppliers, there will likely be the need to subsidise some of the running ourselves. With this in mind, we secured a property large enough to allow us to hold events, meetups, workshops, exhibitions, conferences’ fringe events, and a lot more. These events will a) allow W&W to subsidise running costs, keeping the costs to the designer as low as possible, b) provide a local scene and meeting place for like-minded individuals, and c) allow people to host and attend design events whilst surrounded by inspiring and purchasable design products.</p><p>Renovations to the first property in the W&W family—a Grade II, four-storey building on Newcastle upon Tyne’s Quayside, in the north of England—are currently in progress, and the call for product <a href="https://whositandwhatsit.com/submissions">submissions is open</a>! Do you have a product you’d love to see for sale on the high street? Now you have the perfect opportunity! Don’t have your own products, but know someone who does? Let them know about us!</p><p>W&W is only one small part of this story; the designers, the makers, the independent artists and producers, <em>they’re</em> the main characters on this journey, and we’re on the lookout for all of them.</p><p>I, and the wider W&W team, all have a passion for beautifully designed, carefully crafted, high-quality products, and we want to help independent designers by sharing this passion with a far wider audience—an audience who might otherwise never even know such products exist.</p><p>Here are a few links in one handy list for you:</p><ul><li>Info & Submissions: <a href="https://whositandwhatsit.com/">whositandwhatsit.com</a></li><li>Follow us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/whosit_whatsit">@whosit_whatsit</a></li><li>Befriend us on Facebook: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/whositandwhatsit">facebook.com/whositandwhatsit</a></li><li>For any questions, email us on <a href="mailto:hello@whositandwhatsit.com">hello@whositandwhatsit.com</a></li></ul><p>Here’s to 2014, the year of the independent designer!</p><p>Wishing you good health (and wealth)! <br /><em>Naomi</em></p>
