Burnout hits every 6 months or so. I don’t see it coming, because I’ve been working non-stop, ignoring the
symptoms. But I can tell when it arrives. Work creaks along. My forehead aches. My neck locks. An eye
twitches. Friends invite me out, but I turn inward, hunched over my desk trying to will the machine into
action. I’m not really here though; the machine doesn’t do much without me.

Stress manifests like depression for me. I crave exercise, but can’t be bothered to do it. I have to remind
myself to eat. Every inch of my body growls in the morning. I hibernate in a full-on bear grump. These are
some of the signs. There are others too. In corporate jobs, I hide in the restroom periodically or take a long
walk to breathe deeply. Sometimes I cry. That makes it worse. Stress begets stress. And if you’re anything
like me, feeling useful and contributing to something bigger can be part of the problem. A little addictive
even.

I started working at 14, because I needed the money. I’ve been helping companies with their customers each
year since then. The holiday rush is a big part of that. How can we meet the demands of people we can’t see?
A great question, but maybe the wrong one.

[Stress is dangerous](http://killerstress.stanford.edu). I’m feeling it now, heavy and tiresome. Too much
time on the computer. I need to take my own advice:

 *  Stuck on the same thing for over an hour? Time for a break. Go for a walk. Outside.

 *  Feeling stiff?

 *  Get up every now and then. Make yourself tea or grab a snack.

 *  Eat 3 meals a day.

 *  Breathe. Sit up straight. Whatever you’re doing can wait.

 *  Meditate in the morning.

 *  Read a book at night. Put the screen down. It hurts your eyes. Let them rest too.

 *  Do yoga 3 times a week.

This year was intense. Even good changes are stressful. I have to remember to work the stress out of my body.
These are things that help me. What about you? How do you stay motivated and relaxed?
