       <p>Burnout hits every 6 months or so. I don’t see it coming, because I’ve been working non-stop, ignoring the symptoms. But I can tell when it arrives. Work creaks along. My forehead aches. My neck locks. An eye twitches. Friends invite me out, but I turn inward, hunched over my desk trying to will the machine into action. I’m not really here though; the machine doesn’t do much without me.</p><p>Stress manifests like depression for me. I crave exercise, but can’t be bothered to do it. I have to remind myself to eat. Every inch of my body growls in the morning. I hibernate in a full-on bear grump. These are some of the signs. There are others too. In corporate jobs, I hide in the restroom periodically or take a long walk to breathe deeply. Sometimes I cry. That makes it worse. Stress begets stress. And if you’re anything like me, feeling useful and contributing to something bigger can be part of the problem. A little addictive even.</p><p>I started working at 14, because I needed the money. I’ve been helping companies with their customers each year since then. The holiday rush is a big part of that. How can we meet the demands of people we can’t see? A great question, but maybe the wrong one.</p><p><a href="http://killerstress.stanford.edu">Stress is dangerous</a>. I’m feeling it now, heavy and tiresome. Too much time on the computer. I need to take my own advice:</p><ul><li>Stuck on the same thing for over an hour? Time for a break. Go for a walk. Outside.</li><li>Feeling stiff? <a href="http://kikutowneavclub.tumblr.com/post/9737697316/exercises-to-do-while-standing-at-your-desk-at">Stretch</a>.</li><li>Get up every now and then. Make yourself tea or grab a snack.</li><li>Eat 3 meals a day.</li><li>Breathe. Sit up straight. Whatever you’re doing can wait.</li><li>Meditate in the morning.</li><li>Read a book at night. Put the screen down. It hurts your eyes. Let them rest too.</li><li>Do yoga 3 times a week.</li></ul><p>This year was intense. Even good changes are stressful. I have to remember to work the stress out of my body. These are things that help me. What about you? How do you stay motivated and relaxed?</p>
