       <p>Do you remember the first programming conference you ever attended? </p><p>I do.</p><p>It was an OSCON, in Portland. Something like a thousand people attended it.</p><p>Looking back it was objectively terrible compared to any of the events I’ve attended in the last year. Hosted in a convention center, terrible food, worse coffee, parallel tracks with no coherent narrative. I remember the party was run by Sun Microsystems, not officially part of the conference, and in the open air parking garage of the DoubleTree. Standing around a keg and talking loudly over the echo of the other attendees none of that mattered. I loved it, it was amazing.</p><p>I enjoy the intimate community run conferences around the world I attend now. But when I remember what it was like my first time I have to admit that none of these could have been my first conference.</p><p>I didn’t know anyone back then and the anonymity you get by being one in a sea of people was comforting. The intimate setting of a conference like NodeConf, which I’ve run for the last 3 years, would have been terrifying.</p><p>In the last few years I’ve seen my community grow at an astonishing rate and yet we haven’t created much that is accessible enough to draw most of that community in. For those who are just dipping their toes in the water of JavaScript I want to create an event that draws them in to the deep end.</p><p>I have high hopes for <a href="http://jsfest.com">JSFest</a>, and I hope that you’ll join me.</p>
