# Fragility

We try to build life and a sense of safety into things we make. Everything will be okay. Just click here, fill
in this form, or go to that page. Youâ€™ll find what you need. Your information is private. There are humans
behind the scenes and we have the machines under control. You can trust us. We promise.

We use words like:

 *  forever

 *  secure

 *  clean

 *  flexible

 *  open

 *  scale

 *  sustainable

 *  connected

 *  data

We hope we get it right. (We try to get it right.)

But what if our work is fragile by nature? What metaphors would matter? Would we build things differently or
change anything at all?
