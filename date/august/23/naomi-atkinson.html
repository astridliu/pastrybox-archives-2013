       <p>I’ve recently returned from a week-long Whisky tour of Scotland. I was already a fan of Scotch Whisky before the trip, however being taught the extensive processes involved — learning each distillery’s story and the individuality in each of their products — has changed my perception and appreciation of many whiskys and, in turn, informed me of <em>why</em> I like or favour others. </p><p>It all served to remind me of one extremely important factor in selling any product: <em>storytelling</em>.</p><hr /><p>Offering a customer (or client) a finished product without sharing any part of the story that led up to it can lead to any of a number of issues on a project:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Requests to see other options</strong></p><p>This is due to them asking themselves “Well, what other options are there? Is this really the <em>best</em> one?”</p><p>Sharing your process enables them to see what other options (<em>including</em> the awful clichéd ones that you explain as such) you have decided not to pursue, and why. You don’t need to share fully worked up designs — just sketches, layouts, or thoughts.</p></li><li><p><strong>A lack of respect for you and your work</strong></p><p>Many clients may presume that this is all you have done, therefore it was somehow ‘easy’ or ‘quick’ for you to get to this conclusion. They’re paying you for a service, and they want to know that you have spent a good amount of time on their project.</p><p>If you jumped straight from a brief or discussion to a full comp, or coded up version of a design for example, what is that client meant to think?</p><p>Include them in your thinking, share your process <em>and</em> progress (even if that’s just in word format for the most part), make sure that they’re aware of your time spent on something. Respect is very much a two-way thing for a successful relationship.</p></li><li><p><strong>They may even want to pay less</strong></p><p>I could talk about time-based invoicing versus value-based pricing here, however it’s not really about that. </p><p>Even if you’re at a point in your career where you can go to a client with one solution and say “take it or leave it”, I would still argue that sharing the story of how you ended up at that point is imperative to gain the respect that is needed for the client to be <em>happy</em> to pay their invoice(s).</p></li><li><p><strong>The client’s inability to explain their own brand’s project, meaning, or feel</strong></p><p>Sharing the story — and explaining your work properly to a client — enables them to become their own ambassador of that work. This is crucially important, as you will likely not always be around to support that client. </p><p>Giving them a story to tell, or a one-liner of why something is the way it is, I have found to be one of the most successful aids for a client and their piece of mind.</p></li></ul><hr /><p>Storytelling. We all grew up around it. We all have a story to tell. Don’t let it stop when it comes to your work.</p>
