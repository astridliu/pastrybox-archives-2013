Here’s an observation:

We’ve been creating content with more *opinion* and less *fact*.

Gone are the days when newspapers were wholly factual and unbiased. The news now has partiality; it has some
inherent angle.

Much of the content we seem to read and consume today is opinion. Yet, it’s positioned from a self-help
style, this-is-how-you-should-do-it stance. One that’s a little dangerous. 

We’re getting a little too comfortable with letting other people do the work for us. Instead of doing the
hard research ourselves by trudging through waves of information and making a reasoned decision as to what is
right for oneself, we are apt to ape and mimic. 

What works for someone, lo and behold, may not *work for you*.

The good-ish side? We’re discussing these articles and sentiments. We disagree or agree online, in forums,
on Twitter, in comments, in notes and via email. We get inspired, passionate, angry, upset and back again.


And this is perhaps the saving grace of publishing today, that these are *ideas open for discussion*. 

But that’s just, like, my opinion, man.
