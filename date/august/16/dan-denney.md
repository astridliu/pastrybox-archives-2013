There has been a really interesting shift in the industry for front-end devs. A few years ago, it wasn’t a
very popular full-time position. Most likely, markup was handled by back-end devs and/or designers. We had a
little boom where front-end dev roles were created and offered all throughout the industry. I feel it was
heavily related to the depth of technical knowledge necessary to build sites responsively or specifically for
mobile devices. 

The offering hasn’t changed, but the talent pool has. As a very active member of my local communities,
people reach out to me fairly often when they are hoping to find people to help them build something. For the
last 6 months or so, I’ve mostly shrugged and resorted to tweeting about opportunities that come up. I
don’t personally know a front-end dev that isn’t either swamped with work or completely fulfilled with
their job.

I wonder if this is a local problem or an industry-wide problem. My guess is that it is industry-wide because
even [Google](https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&jid=45098&) is actively seeking
front-end devs. It is either that there aren’t enough front-end devs out there to fill the demand or that
there isn’t enough visibility for them. Things like [CodePen’s hire me
button](http://blog.codepen.io/2013/04/06/hire-me-for-all) help, but we likely need more ways too. If you’re
a front-end dev and you’re looking for work, please make sure people know!
