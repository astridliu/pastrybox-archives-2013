My company turned four years old yesterday. We started it as a small, principled, hyper-focused web design
studio, founded after a long, unsatisfying career in client services, and dedicated to making the best
websites we were capable of.

This year, our company is on track to ship 20,000 t-shirts, so many that weâ€™re considering taking an
extended break from website-making to focus on our t-shirt businesses.

If you have an idea, chase it. Keep chasing it. You may be surprised where it leads you.
