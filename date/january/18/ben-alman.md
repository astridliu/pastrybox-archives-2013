# The year in review, a prediction

*Only twelve thoughts.* That’s all that will have been required of me.

As I will look back on 2013, the year that, then, will soon be coming to a close, I will recall seeing the
list titled [“Here are the dates of Ben Alman’s future
thoughts”](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/baker/ben-alman/) and thinking, at the time, that the dates
listed therein seemed rather arbitrary. “What will be so special about the 18th of the month? Why are
there three exceptions? *What if I will want to have thoughts on other dates?*”

If this year will have been like any other year, I will have spent innumerable minutes weighing actions,
reactions and consequences; I will have tried to be fair, honest and witty through careful observation,
analysis and introspection. But this year won’t have been like any other year, and I will have spent
*numerable* minutes weighing actions, reactions and consequences.

Why? Because the Pastry Box Project will have given me a reason—no, a *mandate*— to have only twelve
thoughts. *Ever again.*

Despite my natural proclivity toward not only thinking but also voicing every single one of my thoughts, much
to the ongoing chagrin of those around me, I will have succeeded in suppressing unscheduled or otherwise
proscribed thoughts until my monthly “thought day,” much to the unexpected *joy* of those around
me.

It won’t have been easy, however. I’m sure that I will have had to have had moments when I
wrestled with the knowledge that I must learn to embrace the *anticipation* of thought in lieu of relying on
the familiar comfort of the predictably unpredictable. While avoiding this internal debate will undoubtedly
have been alluring, it is unlikely that it will have been easily dismissed, considering the appeal of never
again having to think improvisationally or spontaneously.

All but twelve days of this year will have been filled with blissful emptiness, each day relatively free of
thought but full of free time—time that I will have spent breathing, sleeping or perhaps even staring
blankly at things I will most likely be unlikely to be able to recall.

And then I will realize that it’s all over. My twelve thoughts will all be in the past. There
won’t be any new thoughts.

How will I feel? What will I do?

I won’t know, because I won’t have thought about that.
