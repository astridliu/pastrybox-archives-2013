       <p>Our tools and practices refine daily. The inspiration pixel-deluge is unrelenting. Online tuition is a multi-million dollar enterprise. Everybody has an opinion. </p><p>As Geri <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/geri-coady/2013-january-3">commented</a>, ours is a big and sometimes steep learning curve. From webmaster to web designer to front-end developer our roles have become more fragmented and more specialised with time, whilst what we are expected to know to accomplish these roles has grown exponentially. </p><p>It is so easy to feel out of touch with trends and discussions. I remember a time when there were five or six interesting blog posts to read a week. Now there are more than that a minute. My &#8216;to-read&#8217; pile of books is nearing double figures. It has never been easier to feel like you know so little.</p><p>In 2012 I started doing two new things, neither planned: teaching and public speaking. What both these things did was made me realise that there were people out there who knew less than me. I don&#8217;t mean this arrogantly â€” I had always looked at what others knew and focussed on the gaps in my knowledge. Doing both these things made me stop to focus on what I did know. </p><p>I know we&#8217;ve only just met but in 2013 I want you to promise me something. <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/chris-coyier/2013-january-2/">Write more</a>, <a href="http://www.codeclub.org.uk">help others more</a>, be confident that you know more than you think because I guarantee there will be people who can learn from your experiences and knowledge. I bet you know more than you think. </p>
