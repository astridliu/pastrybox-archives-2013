I don’t believe that creativity is a department. In most of the industry, they talk about the
“creatives” and creative directors. I think that’s a really detrimental thing. I won’t put
“creative” in anybody’s title. If you’re not creative, regardless of what your role is, you can’t
work here, period. It’s cost of entry. And I think in general it should be the cost of entry. If we’re in
an idea economy, if we’re in an information economy, then it seems like everybody needs to be creative.
