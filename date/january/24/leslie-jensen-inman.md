# I’m taking back math.

The other day, my mom handed me a stack of papers. I shuffled through them and stopped at a piece of folded
yellow paper. I opened it. The paper contained the results from my third grade Iowa standardized test. I
don’t remember taking an Iowa standardized test when I was eight years old—I grew up in New Jersey, not
Iowa—but I must have because the results were there in front of me. I looked closer at the information. To
my surprise, the area I scored the highest in was math.

I thought about this and realized that the last time I remember feeling smart in math was when I was ten years
old and I was in the fifth grade. I’ve always learned best when I can do the something that I’m supposed
to learn. Mrs. McCarthy, my fifth grade teacher, was pretty amazing because she understood this and she helped
me to not only feel smart in math, but she also helped me to love math. I don’t remember working on specific
math problems or having a math workbook while I was in the fifth grade. What I do remember is playing the
stock market. I remember learning math through doing, through playing. In fifth grade, I learned math through
projects set in real-world contexts and I loved math because of this.

When I think back to the stock market projects, I remember opening up the newspaper. I recall the smell and
the touch of the newsprint. I remember the feeling of excitement at discovering whether or not my predictions
about a specific stock came true. They often did because Mrs. McCarthy taught us about math, language,
business, and culture through the experience of playing the stock market. All of this information lead to
solid predictions. It felt incredible to learn about math this way and it all made sense. I was learning more
than just math. I was learning about many aspects of life—in a holistic way—and I was having fun doing it.


Then, fifth grade was over. It was time to say goodbye to Mrs. McCarthy and hello to my sixth grade math
teacher, Mrs. Chaney.

As I held the yellow paper of the Iowa standardized test in my hands, my mom and I talked about Mrs. McCarthy
and the fun of learning. My mom and I have both been educators. She was a physical education teacher. I’ve
come to understand that physical education is the epitome of learning through doing, learning through playing.
My mom and I talked about the importance of learning through doing. Then my mom said, “Mrs. Chaney stole
math from you.” I looked at my mom. Her face had a mix of anger, frustration, and sadness.

I vividly remember being eleven years old, in my sixth grade math class, sitting in straight rows, instead of
small groups like we sat in fifth grade. In Mrs. Chaney’s class, I sat in the middle of the classroom. My
last name started with a “J” and we were seated alphabetically—middle letter of the alphabet meant
middle of the classroom. I remember raising my hand over and over again to participate in the class. I had
answers and I had questions. I was in the middle of the classroom and I knew my teacher could see me raise my
hand. I don’t ever remember being called on but I do remember the boys in the class being called on. Mrs.
Chaney only called on the boys. After some time, I realized that raising my hand was an exercise in futility
and I stopped raising my hand. I stopped engaging in the class, I stopped feeling smart in math, and I stopped
loving math. I started to realize that gender had meaning far beyond “pink is for girls” and “blue is
for boys.” I understood the lesson Mrs. Chaney was teaching—only boys could do math.

Sixth grade is the year math was taken from me. Although I use numbers on a daily basis, I’ve never felt the
love that I once had for them. I’ve decided to change this. I’ve decided that twenty+ years after math was
taken from me that I’m taking it back.

I’ve also decided to be more aware about myself and the people in my life. I will not allow anyone to take
the things I love away from me. I will not let the things I love go easily and I will do my best not to take
the things other people love away from them. I will fight for what I am passionate about but I will remind
myself that my own words affect others.
