Academy](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/) the other day. It is well
worth reading in its entirety, but let me selectively quote a part that struck
me:

It succinctly captures what I am involved with and see happening in the web standards world. Now for the
second time in fact. First we had the decision in 2004 at a W3C Workshop around Web Applications (now referred
to as “The Workshop”) to no longer work on HTML and JavaScript, but instead focus on XML. To counter that
decision the WHATWG was formed and proved the W3C wrong. The W3C now heralds HTML5 as one of its success
stories.

Now the WHATWG is our new story and it has ably demonstrated that the bureaucracy of the standards process can
be circumvented. More became possible, if you will. The second time came when the W3C reaffirmed its stance on
a restrictive license for specifications. Specifications belong to anyone. They prove themselves by being in
wide use. That combined with the fact that the W3C Process requires editors to do a lot of make work, of which
complaints during my seven years there went unaddressed, made me feel my time would be better spent
elsewhere.
