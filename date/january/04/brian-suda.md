Will big data eat itself? Big data has been the buzz word for a while now. I wonder at what point the term
will become so overloaded it will collapse on itself? Maybe that process has started already. Big is relative,
both in the size of the data, the size of your operations and the size of your tools. I’ll know the term
is empty the day I go through the line at the grocery store and the checkout person swipes my loyalty card and
mentions big data. “The Cloud” was so 2012, I fear for what the term of 2013 will be.
