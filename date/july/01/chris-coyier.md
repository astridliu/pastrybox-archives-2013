Things that would be interesting to watch/read/listen to:

 *  A barber explaining how they interpret people’s explanations of how they want their hair cut.

 *  A dog walker explaining how they successfully find new customers and keep the ones they have.

 *  A grandmother explaining their classic recipe for ginger snaps.

 *  An engineer demonstrating how a rear differential works​.

 *  An accountant pointing out the most common mistakes people make in doing home accounting.

 *  A toy designer explaining the lengths they go to to make toys for very young children safe.

 *  A drag queen giving a speech about the most common misconceptions about drag queens.

 *  ​An astronaut telling a story about the most unusual experience they had in space.

 *  ​A game programmer explaining enemy AI and pathfinding algorithms.

 *  A ceramic artist demonstrating how they work with clay and create their artwork.

 *  An icon designer showing a stack of iterations on a particular icon design and then talking about why they
stopped where they stopped.

 *  A greasy spoon waiter explaining their techniques for managing the slew of mini-chores that is the essence
of being an efficient server.

 *  A database administrator explaining the struggles of scaling at enormous scale.

 *  A hockey player detailing what types of training gets them the most gain during the offseason.

 *  A songwriter sharing some of their ideas on what makes a good song a good song.

People talking directly about what they do is nearly always fascinating to me, regardless of the job, as long
as they exude some passion about it.

This was part of the inspiration for [The Lodge](http://css-tricks.com/lodge/) on my website CSS-Tricks. Less
about dry “training” and more about the fact that it can be interesting and helpful to watch someone do
what they do while they talk about it. [Working in
