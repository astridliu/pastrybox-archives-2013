Brendan Eich [wrote this somewhat poetic
entry](http://blog.tojicode.com/2013/06/a-tale-of-two-web-technologies.html#c2359382555491358783) on why we
evolve the web and its many features rather than introduce versioning or replace features
wholesale:

> We do not get to re-engineer our mtDNA *in situ* now that it has spread
> throughout seven billion people. Making life with new mtDNA would be interesting (and dangerous). Unless you
> make a virus that rewrites seven billion humans’ mtDNA, you have to deal with “backward
> compatibility”.
> Backward compatibility is what binds us most. It is deeply engrained in the web, and in the internet. If
> someone could get past it and spin up a new web, they would soon enough face the same problems we face,
> perhaps with a bit better up-front design helping them get a bit farther toward one idea of
> “perfection”.
> But the evolutionary system doesn’t care about “perfect”, it cares only about “better and
> backward-compatible enough to hop to”.

Within the web there are local exceptions and variations, but the general tide is this.
