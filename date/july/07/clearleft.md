At my secondary school, the head of drama was Peter Maric, a fiery Northerner with Slavic roots who would
shout, spit and swear his way through the day just to keep the spirit of the theatre alive. I loved it. 20
years later, he’s still there.

Anyone who was lazy or who he didn’t like was ‘a shower’. Maric would beat Stanislavsky, Chekov and
Gogol into disinterested South London kids with his sheer force of will. I was inspired by his passion and
attitude; it wasn’t something you saw in many teachers. 

His ‘department of one’ was constantly on the verge of being shut down, so once a year he would stage
plays like ‘The Government Inspector’ or ‘Hiawatha’. The big song and dance left the parents feeling
warm and fuzzy about seeing their kids on stage, gave the management something to show off, but it was
ultimately a survival tactic for theatre education itself.

As I reflect on where I am now, I’ve come to see theatre as one of the most important things I did in
school. Given the [current climate](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article3722052.ece), I wonder if
we’re going to lose something if academic subjects have to prove their economic value, when what you learn
is rather intangible. 

Drama gave me the confidence to stand up in front of anyone and do anything ‘in the name of art’. I’ve
done a fair bit of performance since leaving school, including what I consider to be one of life’s ultimate
lessons: appearing naked on stage (my character lost a game of strip poker… but that’s another story…).


When you’re performing, you enter a zone where the normal rules don’t apply. The trick about it is telling
yourself that it doesn’t matter what people think. Performance forces you to be free of your social
inhibitions, to improvise.

Why might this be so important to design? Our work is useless in a vacuum. You can have the best ideas in the
world, but if you can’t tell the story, if you can’t stand up and be passionate about your work, it is far
less likely to survive. Presenting your work and ideas may only be a tiny fraction of your work time, but
it’s often the most critical. 

In my work as a UX designer at Clearleft, there are times when I have to walk into a room full of people I
don’t know (sometimes with little or no preparation) and tell them an engaging story. Doing this with
confidence is the principal way that I can help a large organisation to change what it does for the
better.

Performance is not new to design. Think about Steve Jobs and his habit of unveiling new products from a bag on
stage. He loved to create mystery for an audience; pure showbusiness. If you’re a designer who struggles to
sell your ideas, I think amateur theatre might be useful career development. Anything that gets you in front
of people and forces you to be something different, something more than you are in everyday life.

There’s also a strange paradox in being a confident performer. Once you get there, the script ceases to
matter as much. You can just flow, be natural, be more yourself. It becomes less of a performance, more like
real life, like you’re just talking to someone. 

If you want to hold their attention, there’s no reason to be showy (or even naked!), just work on being
authentic. Strangely, learning how to perform a theatrical role is good start.
