       <p>I’m often asked “Do you need to be a <em>Jack of all trades</em> in the web industry?”</p><p>I believe there’s a place for two very different types of creatives within the industry (and I’d hasten to include others such as graphic design, advertising, branding, and pretty much any company offering a service): </p><blockquote><p>Those who are passionate about an array of trades (let’s call them “The Jacks”), and those who are passionate about one very specific thing (“The Jills”).</p> </blockquote><p>I’ve worked with some extremely talented people over the years, and they include both types — neither the Jacks or Jills being more successful, nor more respected.</p><p>Mixing Jacks and Jills creates a winning team. </p><p>One problem that I’ve seen many agencies (or studios) face however, is that they have a Jill overseeing or running a project, or indeed the whole company. </p><p>Who they really need in this role is a Jack. Someone who is wired to think about every area, the biggest picture — not just the management itself for instance. </p><p>By this, I don’t mean to pigeon-hole Jills into lower-level roles. A Jill is required at Director level too — just <em>in their specific area</em> — a technical, or creative director for example. But the key here is to make sure that there is always a Jack present.</p><p>So there you have it — a nursery rhyme for agency success.</p>
