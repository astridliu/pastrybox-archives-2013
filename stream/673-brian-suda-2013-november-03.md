When I wrote this, 3D printing was becoming annoyingly overhyped, so by the time you read this I can imagine
your disgust already. I get the feeling that people who have grown up post-digital and work in a digital world
are yearning for something more physical and tactile. A touch screen that can morph to anything is an entrance
into a world where just about anything goes, but at the same time we also want our fancy pens and notebooks
with leather-bound cases. There is certainly the pull between atoms and bits, we can rearrange atoms with our
bits and our atoms control and save our bits. What will happen when we make the jump from laser cutting
plastics, wood and paper and printing plastics and chocolates to actually assembling DNA? We do that now,
people have made programs using proteins and DNA, but what does that even mean for our future?
