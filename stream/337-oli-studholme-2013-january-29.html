       <h1>On Empathy</h1><p>I ♡ our industry. Thanks to the blessing of View Source, the web has been egalitarian from the start — all we need are a computer, an internet connection, and the determination to learn. The lack of accreditation means we’re hired on the strength of our portfolio or GitHub account, and in general our industry feels like a meritocracy — do great work and you’ll be recognised for it.</p><p>I also feel despite the stereotypes that we’re on the whole a sociable and easy-going bunch, both online and In Real Life. We like attending the many conferences and meetups, and the leaders of our industry are amazingly approachable. Meeting others at events I feel a shared love for technology and making the world a better place, a wonderful “these are my people” feeling. I’d even go so far as to say that as a group we’re caring, of above average intelligence and attractiveness, and of course empathetic.</p><p>Well, <em>I</em> certainly considered myself to be empathetic. That is, until I discovered I’m not.</p><h2>A fish in water</h2><p>I realised this talking to my daughter about her teddy (bear with me…). She replied to “Come get him” with “You mean <em>her</em>”. I’d subconsciously perceived teddy bears as masculine, as if English words were gendered (like <em>“L’ours en peluche”</em>), but for my daughter the gender was naturally feminine. To think about this, it’s obvious. But for me this conversation was the difference between thinking and <em>empathising</em>. I use gender-neutral words with her now, like waiting for the “green person” to cross the road, and referring to toys as “they”, not “he” or “she”.</p><p>Coming to Japan was also an eye-opening experience for me. Along with the amazing experiences and wonderful people, many things I’d taken for granted or never even thought about are … <em>different</em> here. One that surprised me was how I reacted to being treated differently because I looked Western. Generally this attention has been positive — people making a fuss of me. But sometimes I just don’t feel like answering “Are you American?” again, or being complimented on my ability to use chopsticks. Sometimes I just want to be treated like everyone else. I soon learned those questions are just easy conversation starters for Japanese people not used to talking with foreigners. But even knowing that I still find this peculiar feeling of being “the other” can be unsettling, even when the attention is positive.</p><h2>Empathy and us</h2><p>Seeing things from someone else’s perspective is easy to intellectualise, but <em>actually doing it</em> is completely different, and considerably harder. People talk about walking a mile in someone else’s shoes, but few ever tie up the laces and do it. However, empathy is a core competency for us — <strong>we make things for people to use</strong>. If we don’t help the people using what we’ve made, we’ve failed, no matter how beautiful the design or elegant the code. This is incredibly obvious, but because we naturally assume other people are like us, it’s easy to <em>think</em> empathy without <em>feeling</em> it. We all have a self-image of being empathetic, and nobody says empathy is hard. But it is.</p><p>Luckily many of our best practices are exercises in empathy: user testing, personas, site visits, stakeholder interviews and even client meetings all provide valuable chances to see a project through other people’s eyes.</p><h2>Level up in empathy</h2><p>The easiest thing we can do to become more empathetic is to improve communication with clients, colleagues, and the people who will use our projects. It’s easy to assume motivations and guess at intentions — much of what we perceive is actually internally constructed, so listening to what is said (rather than hearing what we expect) can be surprisingly difficult. Frequent face-to-face communication helps, and building these relationships naturally makes us more empathetic.</p><p>When someone disagrees, try to avoid the temptation to “win the debate”, and instead focus on understanding what they believe, and why. A good test is how you react to criticism — treating it as potentially valuable feedback from a different perspective, and empathising with the person, helps to avoid taking it as an attack.</p><p>When you’re starting a new project, try to arrange time with someone who will use what you’re making, and if applicable consider volunteering to help them do that task for an hour or two. People are inventive and unpredictable, so you’ll probably discover some novel workflow, a feature that isn’t in the brief, or just a different perspective. Meeting people who’ll actually use what you produce is also a great help for frequent informal user testing and feedback later on.</p><p>More generally, try to get out of your comfort zone — learn new things unrelated to web development, talk to people from different walks of life, volunteer, travel somewhere you don’t speak the language. Although having kids might be a little extreme, using the web while holding a baby is a great insight into why usability is so important. Trying to use the web in a different language is also eye-opening, and has helped me realise the importance of copywriting, and consider how a non-native speaker might use what I make. Try ordering something on the Japanese Apple store, and see how far you can get!</p><p>Our self-image of (and job requirement for) empathy also makes <a href="http://www.netmagazine.com/features/primer-sexism-tech-industry">recent online discussions of sexism in tech</a>, with <a href="https://twitter.com/wilto/status/182171798358601728">female beer pourers</a> and <a href="http://www.garann.com/dev/2012/hostess-and-britruby/">all-male conference lineups</a>, seem even more out-of-place to me. Reading <a href="https://twitter.com/yesyouresexist">@yesyouresexist</a> is an amusing (and depressing) reminder of how unempathetic and self-deluded other people can be. But <em>we</em> are also “those people” on occasion, without even realising.</p><p>Luckily, <a href="http://nerduo.com/thebattle/">knowledge is half the battle</a> — just knowing that empathy is hard helps. As the year kicks off, let’s go beyond just “keeping the user in mind”, and aim for a more fundamental empathy with everyone involved. In addition to better working relationships, it’ll make our work noticeably better too.</p><p>♡</p>
