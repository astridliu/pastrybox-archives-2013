The student I mentored for the [Skills Canada National
Competition](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/geri-coady/2013-april-11/) won a bronze medal in the intense
two-day Web Development and Design competition in Vancouver last month. I’m really proud of him, especially
considering that he only started to learn web design a couple of months ago. It’s nice to be reminded of
what you can achieve if you really give it your all, and how great it feels to see a student develop a
passion. It’s what teaching is all about.
