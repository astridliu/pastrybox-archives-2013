# Don’t Judge a Drink by Its Container

The newest form of media — the stream — already takes its name from a form of water. What if we extended
this metaphor to other media? Lake Superior and Lake Michigan might be titanic newspapers, calm bodies whose
surfaces are burned off by the sun every morning. Books could be liquids bound by bottles in all shapes and
sizes. (People will say, don’t judge a drink by its container.) Imagine Captain Nemo, sealed off in his
submarine library, floating through tons and tons of water.

Browsing online would be like cloud-watching — fleeting and boundless, perhaps, but also fantastically
associative and unpredictable. And maybe Google is the ocean, where all water eventually flows into.

Marking an article for Read-It-Later would be like freezing up ice cubes. How many get angry at people
rebottling their drinks in the containers of their convenience?

This exercise is a bit indulgent and silly, but gets interesting when you start working backwards. Come up
with an element of water — now what’s the media form equivalent?
