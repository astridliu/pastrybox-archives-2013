    <p class="baked-by">baked by Clearleft</p>
    
    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>During the early years of Clearleft we’d say yes to every client that came our way, for fear it’d be the last. A week later our dream project would come along and we’d have to turn it down due to lack of resources. I’d hate to think how many amazing opportunities we lost because we couldn’t say “no”. We’d find ourselves working on projects that paid the bills, but were hardly stimulating— things that wouldn’t sit proudly in our portfolio or further our goals. On occasion we’d be stuck with difficult or unpleasant customers and wish we’d said “no” from the outset. Despite this, we’d continue to struggle on regardless.</p><p>Too many designers operate from a position of fear, worrying where the next check will come from. They’ll try to win every client that comes their way, whether they are suitable or not.</p><p>This attitude helps fuel one of our industry’s least endearing qualities—the tendency to bitch about clients. The thing is, as a company you chose the people you work with, so it’s your fault rather than theirs.</p><p>While most agencies try to win every project by promising to deliver everything the client wants and more, we take a radically different approach.</p><p>It’s my job to make sure a client is a good fit for Clearleft, so I’ll sound out their attitudes to quality, how they like to collaborate, and their management style. I’ve got very good at spotting the type of clients we work best with, and the warning signs to look out for.</p><p>It’s also my job to see whether we’re going to be a good fit for the client, and I’ll regularly turn down work because I think somebody else would do a better job. This may seem like a strange attitude, but I feel a duty of care to the people who approach us and want to offer the best advice possible, even if that means recommending somebody else (which I do a lot).</p><p>We’re also very honest with our prospective clients and don’t play the sales game—we’re designers after all. Instead we’ll explain that they won’t get everything they want, that the process will be hard and that we’ll make a few wrong turns along the way. We say this because design is messy and we don’t want to start the relationship on a lie. Some clients don’t want to hear this and that’s OK. Others appreciate the honesty and really want to work with us.</p><p>There’s something fantastically empowering about turning down a project or client you don’t feel is a good fit, especially when a better fit is just around the corner. It’s also surprising the level of respect you can get from the companies you’ve turned down if they understand the reasons.</p><p>So try saying “no” during the sales process a little more and you may just find it turns into more and better “yes’s”.   </p><p style="text-align: right"><a href="http://www.andybudd.com/">—Andy Budd</a></p>
