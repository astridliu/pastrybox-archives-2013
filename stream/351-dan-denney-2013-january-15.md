The W3C is keeping a copy of [the first website ever
made](http://www.w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) online. If they
weren’t, though, it could just be gone forever. This makes me wonder what we should be doing to preserve
things from this digital world that we are creating.

Originally, my concern was about whether the story of how the internet was created will be preserved as we
progress. There are important things like the introduction of images, CSS, JavaScript, etc. For example, I
would love to be able to see the “Batman Forever” site that got Jeffrey Zeldman started with web
building. Preserving examples of the internet’s growth is tiny compared to the bigger impact that this
could have, though.

As we move more parts of our daily life to bits instead of materials, are we risking their total loss? We have
learned so much about human life by archeologists piecing together drawings, writings, tools and personal
items found from people that lived long before us. As we do less of that on materials that don’t require
power, I believe that we have to be more adamant about ensuring that there is a way to protect them.

It seems like we need a plan for preserving things both digitally and physically. Like we do with national
parks or historic zoning, maybe we should protect significant properties. Showing an archived progress of
sites like dictionary.com and Wikipedia (amongst others) would say a lot about the internet and human life.
There also needs to be protection against the biggest enemy of our digital world: lack of power. We have
always lost important artifacts to fire, natural disasters and human destruction. Digital items are
significantly more fragile in that they require specific technology and power in order to access them.

It’s important to keep moving and growing the internet at this fast pace because it is changing the
world. I just think that some of us might need to make sure there’s a way for people to know how we did
it.
