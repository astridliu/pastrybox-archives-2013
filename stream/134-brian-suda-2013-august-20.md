Just listen. After writing, that’s the most important skill you can always improve. I’ve been fortunate in
my life to meet some incredibly famous and smart people. Those attributes are not always connected. The best
times with these people have been not when I’m trying to brag about my accomplishments, but to simply ask
about theirs, then listen. Everyone loves to talk about their ideas, projects, success and failures, some just
need to be prodded. You know about your failures and successes, no need to waste their time talking about
yourself. Simply ask them a smart question, sit back, listen and learn. You’ll be glad you did.
