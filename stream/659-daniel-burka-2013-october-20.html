       <p>I’m about to write some hippy-dippy shit. As you may have noticed from my previous posts here, I’m more inclined to write about work and less about personal issues. So, I’m going to fucking swear a little bit so I don’t feel so self-conscious.</p><p>My wife, Sharon, has recently pushed me to be more wholehearted. Not just wholehearted, but a kind of capital W maybe followed by a mother effin’ trademark Wholehearted™. Ok, enough with the faux tough guy swearing.</p><p>I’m often sarcastic about, well, anything. I frequently err on the critical side of critique in my design career. I smugly make comments about other people’s attire when I’m in the safety of my car. Heck, I’ve tweeted plenty and as we all know Twitter is greased with the bile of cynicism. And when I consciously stop and think about it, it’s almost always totally unnecessary. </p><p>I guess I get a short sugar rush of superiority by belittling someone else and cynicism masquerades as cleverness. Also, there’s nothing wrong with criticism when you’re critiquing someone’s work, but it’s so easy and encouraging to point out the positives too. More often than not, sarcasm, criticism, cynicism, and snarkiness stem from either knee-jerk habit or come from a truly destructive place that most of us forget is hiding inside us.</p><p>So, I’m trying to stop doing it.</p><p>As Sharon has encouraged, I’m trying to consciously be more wholehearted. When we’re in the car and I make some brilliant quip about a hipster’s ironic flood pants, she kindly reminds me, “That’s not very wholehearted.” And, as corny as that sounds, it’s totally working. Often, I still form a sarcastic thought in my brain before consciously quashing it, but over time I’ll hopefully nip it in the bud.</p><p>A few months ago, I thought this was the cheesiest, most crunchy thing I’d ever heard. But now I’m wholehearted in my support of attempting to live a more wholehearted life. I have a ways to go, but I already feel better for it.</p>
