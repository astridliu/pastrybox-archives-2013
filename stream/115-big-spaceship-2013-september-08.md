Each team at Spaceship has their own habits and diverse approaches — the ways we work are as different as
the myriad skills that exist in our teams’ midsts which range from generative art to ludology to fire
(according to a recent internal survey). We are scrappy and resilient and passionate, and also human — it is
that fluctuation we share along the way between excitement, apathy, exhaustion, mystic-vision-induced
latenight problem solving and personal investment that helps us build character into the product we create.
