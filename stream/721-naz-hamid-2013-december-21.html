       <p>“Get used to falling. Pick yourself up quick, and keep moving.”</p><p>I fell off my bike recently. It wasn’t too glamourous; though, if I recount the tale, it’d go something like this:</p><p>“I was bombing the fire roads downhill to Kirby Cove in the Marin Headlands. The gravel path had dried out to loose and chunky rock that made traction a tricky proposition. I have a new bike, so I was excited to take it out on its maiden voyage. I got a little bike-drunk — riding faster than usual, looser than usual. I took a corner too hot, and as I was navigating it, the ground slid out beneath me, and there I was on my ass. I knew it was coming, though.”</p><p>I got up immediately. My friends Adam and Bill were there to help and provide support — thanks!</p><p>I assessed myself. A big ol’ dime-size patch of skin was barely dangling on my palm, which I immediately ripped off, to the groans and eeks of my companions. When the adrenaline is pumping, do the worst bits. The pain hasn’t kicked in yet. I looked at the gravel rash on my left buttock — yep, there were some pebbles lodged into the abrasion, and I picked them out as much as possible. I took a breath, two, then I jumped back on the bike and kept descending. </p><p>I never stop too long when something goes awry — just long enough to assess the situation and start making decisions. Is it something that needs to be fixed, remedied, paid attention to? I move on to problem-solving quickly. Wallowing is difficult for me; perhaps it’s bad form or somehow I’m not allowing myself to really <em>feel</em> by blindly moving forward, but I march ahead nonetheless.</p><p>And that’s the important part. Paying attention to the here and now, but knowing there’s a way through, a way into the future.</p>
