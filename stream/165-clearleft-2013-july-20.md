Responsive design is an integrated process that requires designers and developers to work in harmony. It’s
not a process that involves a designer mocking up 3 different versions of a page (small, medium and large) and
then handing it over the wall to a developer.

If you’re doing this, please stop. You misread the memo and are doing it wrong!
