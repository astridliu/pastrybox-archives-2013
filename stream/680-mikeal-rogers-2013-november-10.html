       <h1>Of the Web</h1><blockquote><p>Let me tell you something: Django may be built <em>for</em> the Web, but CouchDB is built <em>of</em> the Web.</p> â€“Jacob Kaplan Moss in <a href="http://jacobian.org/writing/of-the-web/">October of 2007</a></blockquote><p>I remember this quote often. It is what drew me to CouchDB in 2007.</p><p>Node.js was of the web. It was written in the language of the web. The degree to which we supported the HTTP spec was a point of pride. The latest web standards, like WebSockets, found their first good home in Node.js. Our community evolved to carry the new Web from spec to experience.</p><p>Over the last few years something has changed. What I used to see clearly as a "frontend" community and a "backend" community is now a memory. At first the lines blurred. Now they no longer exist. For most web developers Node.js is something they take for granted as easily as jQuery.</p><p>Tools like <a href="https://github.com/substack/node-browserify">browserify</a> make Node's module ecosystem directly accessible in the browser. Projects like <a href="https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt">Grunt</a> use Node to automate the mundane tasks that plague every web developer. These are accessible to every <strong>web</strong> developer. Web developers move seamlessly through operating system and browser. Each component uses common language and a few standard patterns. Code now blurs the lines between realms and so people do the same.</p><p>There is no longer a Node community. Node has become a vertebra in the spine of the Web. People will surely identify with a camp be it Grunt, Node, or Lo-Dash. But we should not confuse identity with community.</p><p>I often publish a little module. It may be for a single website to be run in Node.js. I resign those restrictions in the act of publication. The accessibility of npm, the capabilities it gains when connected with other modules, give it more meaning than I did alone. Any developer can use this module in any environment. They consume it with even less effort than it took for me to publish it.</p><p>Compatibility increases accessibility. As people join the ecosystem their consumption is a form of collaboration. Collaboration in the absence of coordination. The ensuing growth is more than we can identify as "frontend", "backend", "Node", or "Grunt." We are left with only the identity of "The Web."</p>
