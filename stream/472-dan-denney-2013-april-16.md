I have a really bad habit or anti-habit that I am trying to break. Documentation and specs are often the last
place that I look when I’m trying to figure things out. (I know, I know. I’m so glad I can’t see the
look of horror and disdain on your face.)

When I’m messing with something new, I tend towards “just figuring it out” or Googling in order to find
related blog posts and Stack Overflow questions. I’ve tweeted questions and even reached out specifically to
people involved with the project to ask a question before reading documentation. Super bad. (I’m on Twitter
a lot so I also know I'm not the only one with this habit.)

I’m not sure why I’m so documentation averse. Maybe it’s growing up in the 80s and 90s where novels were
shipped with electronic devices to explain them. Anyhow, something clicked a while back and I’ve been slowly
changing my evil ways. I realized that the people I look up to in front-end development all learn by reading
specs and documentation, then experimenting. I could tell from their blog posts or their in-office
explanations that they dive into these mysterious collections of information and learn useful information that
makes them better.

I’ve been playful about explaining this, but here is my real point. Documentation is seriously underrated in
our community and the people who write it tend to be unsung heroes. A ton of work goes into writing supporting
docs. If you make the time to really read them you will learn so much more. The more that we focus on
consuming docs, the better they will become. 

If you’re like me, let’s dive into the docs a little more and use Twitter to thank people for writing
them.
