# The nature of things

The Iga pottery festival was last weekend. This wabi-sabi style of Japanese pottery is the opposite of
fine china: it’s rough, unmistakably a lump of clay, the kind of earthenware you could imagine finding in a
rustic farmhouse. Like Popeye, it is what it is, and this gives it an honest
beauty.![img](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/manabu-atarashii-plate.jpg)Iga

In architecture, [Tadao Ando](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tadao_Ando) has become famous for buildings of
simple beauty with the concrete left exposed, including the depressions from the concrete framing.
[Traditional Japanese knives](http://ia.net/blog/kenya-hara-on-japanese-aesthetics/) are also plain, yet more
beautiful for it. These examples are true to the nature of their materials. There’s no need for
ornamentation.

So what is the intrinsic nature of the web?

From a practical perspective, [web design is 95%
typography](http://ia.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/). More fundamentally, we can see the
inclusive, humanist underpinnings of the web in the [HTML Design
Principles](http://www.w3.org/TR/html-design-principles/). These include ideas such as universal access, the
priority of constituencies, and interoperability. Responsive Web Design is an expression of this humane
outlook.

Philosophically, I see the web’s intrinsic nature in storytelling: communication between people. A simple
and beautiful example is [Hi](https://sayhi.co/), a “[networked storytelling
tool](https://medium.com/hi-narrative-mapping-1/4c78e6883ec0)” from Craig Mod, Chris Palmieri, and AQ
Works.

The web is not TV, or print design, or any of the things that have come before. *It is what it is.* And
we’re still collectively figuring it out.
