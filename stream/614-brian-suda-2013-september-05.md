There is a probably apocryphal story about Abe Lincoln saying if you give him 4 hours to chop down a tree,
he’d spend the first 3 hours sharpening his axe. It doesn’t really matter who said it, or what they were
going to cut down. Many people ask me about getting into data visualisations, programming or working on the
web. The questions usually revolve around, where do I start and how do I get better? It has been so long,
I’ve forgotten how to get started — and to be honest, the way I got started and the right way to get
started are probably two very different things. I can tell you how to get better — that’s easy. You need
to keep an open mind and practice and practice. That final, beautiful design you see probably has more hours
than you can count getting to that point. If you want to execute on a job well done, you need to put in a lot
of time practicing and sharpening your tools, both mentally and physically.
