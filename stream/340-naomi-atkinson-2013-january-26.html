       <p>Can we <em>truly</em> reflect a product or service’s <strong>brand</strong> if we only create one small part of it?</p><p>In my personal experience, I can easily say that the projects where I’ve had complete control or continuous input into all design and communication decisions have been by far (and continue to be) the most successful for client and studio alike.</p><p>We all know that a brand is so much more than a logo, typeface, and colour palette. So why is it that we accept projects where these may be the only things supplied to us?</p><p>I’ve found myself challenging this over and over again since starting my own studio, especially coming from my previous role at a respected London branding agency. Every time I work with a new client who has an existing identity, I educate them to understand the importance of a cohesive brand experience — usually through sharing improvements to, and further applications of, their current brand language<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1" class="footnote-jump">1</a></sup> rather than trying to find the right words.</p><p>These clients have very quickly come to appreciate the importance of us taking their whole brand into consideration, before jumping straight into “what they need”.</p><p>This is, interestingly, the way it always goes too. Never have I had a new client approach me who already had a brand that spoke volumes, always with a consistent style, tone, and message. If they did, I would have to challenge them on why they are only now turning to me, when they are quite obviously in complete control. Why would they want to jeopardise the strength of their brand by involving someone outside of the thinking to date? With the correct answer, I might choose to take them on as a client — but if they didn’t know why, I’d advise them to continue using whoever they had been using all along.</p><p>Whether it’s a brand’s main website, a private customer area, an app, a digital or physical banner, an exhibition space, business card, door sign, a sub-brand, a customer email, how staff converse, what is sent out in the post, or how the brand attracts new business, there always needs to be someone thinking at this elevated level. Even if it is not you who creates all of these elements, you should always make the effort to be aware of all of them, advise on them if you can, and offer your expertise while wearing their brand cap.</p><p>To sum up — as designers, we need to take on the responsibility of a client’s entire brand when accepting work. If you simply “do your bit” without thought into how it fits into the bigger picture, you’re doing yourself and your client an injustice.</p><br /><p id="fn1" class="footnote"><sup><a href="#r1" class="footnote-jump">1</a></sup> Brand language is a term I use to encapsulate all…</p>
