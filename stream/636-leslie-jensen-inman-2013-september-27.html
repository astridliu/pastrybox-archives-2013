       <h1>Work hard at being fortunate</h1><p>I keep finding myself saying “I’m so fortunate. I’m so lucky.”</p><p>It’s something I think and feel each and every day. The thing is, thinking and feeling <em>I’m fortunate and lucky</em> kind of feels crazy. Crazy because this week, this month, and this year have been filled with chaos and challenges.</p><p>Earlier this year, I ended up in bed sick for about three weeks. I had a severe case of sinusitis which meant I couldn’t smell and my entire body felt like there were spiders crawling underneath my skin (a side-effect of the medication). I couldn’t drive or leave the house because the medication was so strong that it altered my vision and motor function. During this time my husband flew 1,300 miles away to help his mom through cancer treatments, all while other members of my family were going through a similarly difficult time plagued with destructive illness. It was a time filled with lots of chaos and challenges. The weird thing was, I <em>still</em> felt lucky. </p><p>Through these experiences, I gained perspective on things like: time, health, and relationships. Sometimes, life stinks and sometimes it seems especially odoriferous. Even still, I wake every day and think to myself, “I’m so fortunate. I’m so lucky.” This year has been tough but I am fortunate to have gained: perspective, patience, and understanding. I am fortunate to be surrounded by good people.</p><p>I may feel lucky, but I don’t really believe in luck. I do believe that I can feel lucky and I can be perceived to be lucky. I believe working hard leads to good fortune—that being prepared for opportunity and being ready to embrace it makes you seem lucky to those around you, even when your world is upside down.</p><p>Many of us in our industry are perceived as lucky. However, we are not here today, collaborating on exciting projects and exploring new worlds, because we are lucky. We are here because we wanted more. We wanted more from life and we’ve been willing to put forth the effort to accomplish this. </p><p>How we roll, as an industry, is by rolling up our sleeves and getting stuff done. We jump in headfirst and we submerse our entire beings into our work. So much so, that our lives and work are interwoven into one tangled, beautiful mess. </p><p>And when we can’t find opportunity, we make it. What did comedian Milton Berle once say: “If opportunity doesn’t knock, build a door”? We are an industry made of people who build doors for ourselves <em>and</em> for others. Then, we take steps to open the doors and cross over the thresholds—often crossing thresholds <em>together</em>.</p><p>In life, we are faced with a variety of doors that we can walk through. Some are heavy—really heavy—and we cannot open them ourselves. This is when we call on our friends, family, and colleagues to let them know our goals and to let them know that we need assistance in opening a door, a door that will lead us on a new journey and bring more opportunities.</p><p>Most people want to help and by allowing them to help, we give them the opportunity to feel good about themselves. We allow them to make a positive difference in our lives. My friends, family, and colleagues supported me when I was sick and faced serious life challenges. These same people know that when they need me to provide extra support for them, I will be there—wherever their “there” may be.</p><p>When we start and end each day by focusing on things that make us feel fortunate, we begin to frame our lives in a way that seems fortunate. Instead of falling victim to my circumstances, I view this year’s sickness, chaos, and challenges as opportunities. It’s up to me to take these situations and apply what I’ve learned to my life. It’s up to me to recognize when opportunity is knocking, even when it is disguised as chaos. This type of framing allows me to better handle life’s tough situations. Life has a way of finding balance—that painful moments are oftentimes mirrored by exciting opportunities. This awareness helps me prepare for the fun and the not-so-fun aspects of life. </p><p>Let’s take our tangled beautiful messes, and: support each other through tough times, help each other frame our lives through a lens of feeling fortunate, and remind each other that even the chaos and challenges are filled with opportunities for learning and growth. </p><p>We aren’t lucky. We work hard at being fortunate.</p>
