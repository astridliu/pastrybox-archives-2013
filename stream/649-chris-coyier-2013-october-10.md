There is a person somewhere in the world whose job it is to create an account on CodePen and create a bunch of
spam Pens (we call a demo that you build on CodePen with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a “Pen”). They look
like “landing pages” full of cheesy stock photography, keyword ridden text, and huge buttons. They link to
nefarious places to buy prescription drugs illegally or apply for a payday loan.

When I’m particularly frustrated, I think about changing my opinion on the death penalty. This asshole is
using my software, which I work so hard at making awesome, to cheat and steal from others. 

And not only are they trying to hurt others, they hurt me. Their spam puts CodePen at risk of Google thinking
it’s a spam farm and displaying nasty warnings when people come there and removing us from search results. A
devastating blow for any website.

And not only are they hurting others and me, they are hurting my team. All of us want CodePen to succeed
because we believe in it, but we also need it to succeed because we’re trying to make a good life for
ourselves and not succeeding means taking a step back.

And not only are they hurting others, me, and my team, they are hurting the internet. Think of how much better
the internet would be if so many smart people didn’t constantly have to spend so much time and mental effort
battling nefarious crap like spam and online fraud. Straight up, it would be better. Information would be
easier to find, at least. 

So this asshole is basically roundhouse kicking everything in my life that I love. And for that they should
die. 

But then I’m having a better day and new thoughts replace those murderous ones. Surely life is quite hard
where this spammer lives. Maybe getting a job at the spam factory is the only way they can feed their family.
They are just clicking some buttons and hitting some keys — how bad is that really? Certainly it’s not as
bad as their cousin who shovels industrial waste into the river. 

And here I am, with my great life in my happy home on my high horse thinking awful things about them. Should I
just shut up and deal with it? Or are these really terrible people who need a dose of wrath? Or is there some
middle ground? I wish I knew how to do life good.
