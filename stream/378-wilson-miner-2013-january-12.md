Every product is a hypothesis. We start with a guess: I think this will work, I think this will be better, I
think this is true. And we build something to test that guess. Then we learn something, and we try again. This
formula doesn’t preclude art or creative choice or instinct or boldness at any point along the way. But
it’s a place to start, and it’s a method to return to, to ground what we’re doing.
