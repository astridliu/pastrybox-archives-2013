Job descriptions make developers out to be even more legendary — requesting 10 years of experience in a
platform that has only been around for 5 or listing every language ever used expecting expert knowledge in all
of them. It’s not realistic, but to a certain degree it is expected, and it’s that expectation that makes
a developer’s job interesting and inherently challenging. The only predictable thing about our work is that
it’s not. No amount of education can prepare you for this universal truth, it can only be understood by
doing.
