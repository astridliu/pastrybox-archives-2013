Process is not inherently toxic. Yes, a bad process can obfuscate what’s really happening and delay progress
toward a goal. But a good process standardizes the communication around an effort, reducing the propensity for
the overhead of communication to suck time away from actually getting things done. If you don’t like
process, maybe what you really mean is you don’t like your process — your team’s, your company’s, your
own. Fix it; don’t throw it away because it has a dirty name.
