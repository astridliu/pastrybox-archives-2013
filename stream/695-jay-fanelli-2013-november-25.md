Four years ago, my business partner and I quit our jobs to start a web design studio. We had two new MacBooks,
one big (stolen) client, and $0 in the bank. We had no social media followers, no blog, no industry friends,
no backup plan. It was touch and go, but we successfully walked the tightrope without a safety net.

Two weeks ago, [we quit our jobs again](http://www.fullstopinteractive.com), this time to focus on two side
projects we’ve been working on for a long time. Again, we have new MacBooks and $0 in the bank. We’re on
the tightrope again. But this time, we have all the industry friends in the world. And if we fall, we hope
you’ll be there to catch us.
