Learning about imposter syndrome is comforting, at first.

Everyone seems to have it, and when anyone talks about feeling lost, the first reassurance seems to be:
*It’s ok! So do I!*

If someone you admire, who is highly competent, can feel like a fraud or simply lucky, then you’re fine.
Whew. You’re just the same as them! (And maybe you’re just as talented as they are, too.)

But I think it’s dangerous to tell that to people, despite how tempting it is to believe. Because the
feelings that come from actual incompetence and the feelings that come from just being blind to your talent
— well, it’s hard to tell them apart. From your limited perspective, it may be impossible. And if
they’re actually incompetent, telling them that nothing’s wrong and to ignore their disquiet is the worst
mistake to make.

Instead, perhaps consider:

 *  __Identifying blind spots.__ Is there anything obvious and foundational that is missing? Gaps in knowledge
can be papered over or avoided for a while, but they should be identified first, before they can be slowly
reinforced.

 *  __Reminding them what they already know.__ It’s common, when feeling clueless, to imagine everything you
know to be just a subset of what everyone else knows (or should know). But that’s not how knowledge works:
it’s not one large pool, but many scattered puddles of varying sizes. The more related two bodies of
knowledge are, the more adjacent the puddles will be. It may be valuable to bridge puddles together, to let
them mix and feed into one another. And if a blind spot has been identified, reaching it by connecting what
you already know will be easier and more interesting than starting from scratch.

 *  __Seeing if there’s a mismatch between taste and skill.__ This [Ira Glass
quote](http://kottke.org/11/04/your-taste-is-why-your-own-work-disappoints-you) is well-known: but it cuts
both ways. Just as your skill may not yet meet your high standards, you may also be quite skilled but not have
developed taste — not having a strong enough sense of what’s great and what can be dropped. If one far
exceeds the other, it’s time to work on bolstering what’s fallen short.

 *  __Guiding them towards doing the above by themselves.__ This is the hardest one. But they’re not always
going to have someone else they trust and knows them better than themselves. It’ll require being honest and
vulnerable, and will feel like digging around in an open wound. It’s not pleasant, but it’s
necessary.
