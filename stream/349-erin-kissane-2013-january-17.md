I was going to post something else here, about time and travel. But all I really want to say now is that our
world is less bright without [Aaron Swartz](http://boingboing.net/2013/01/12/rip-aaron-swartz.html) in it. He
helped make RSS, Markdown, Creative Commons, OpenLibrary, and Reddit. He did [critical
work](http://blog.okfn.org/2013/01/14/goodbye-aaron-swartz-and-long-live-your-legacy/) in the open access
world. He was extraordinarily generous with his time, which turned out to be heartbreakingly short. 

[He was a maker](http://www.hyperorg.com/blogger/2013/01/13/aaron-swartz-was-not-a-hacker-he-was-a-builder/)
and an activist. He helped stop SOPA and founded Demand Progress and illustrated so clearly that [change in
the world is about more than shouting on the
internet](http://dwillis.net/post/40483840271/on-aaron-swartz).

[Rick Perlstein](http://www.thenation.com/blog/172187/aaron-swartz#) explains a few of the ways in which Aaron
strung together our web:

> smart, dedicated people like him worked very hard, often
> with no thought of personal profit or gain, making ours a world of useful data, making data useful, making it
> possible to have a record of the world as it goes by, making the world more meaningful by making data more
> human and shapable and direction-ful 

There’s so much more, but this isn’t a list. I have no personal remembrances; we never met. The world was
better with him in it. [There is so much left to be
done.](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2013/01/aaron_swartzs_crime_and_the_bu.html)
