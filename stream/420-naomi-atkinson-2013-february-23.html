       <p>I’ve always been supportive of charities, caring enough about the good work they do to give a one-off donation, sign up for a monthly payment, or offer fundraising to those taking up challenges. I’ve also been lucky to have worked with many charities over the years.</p><p>That said, I still find myself awkwardly trying to avoid, or talk myself out of being stopped on the street by the people in a particularly colourful jacket or bib.</p><p>My awkwardness was squashed a couple of months ago by a colourful jacket informing me that all I had to do was send an SMS. That was it. Nothing to fill in, and no catch. He showed me a card with the number to text, as well as three suggested donations: £2, £3, or £5.</p><p>Within 30 seconds I had donated £5 which would simply be added to my next phone bill. I went on my way. Brilliant.</p><p>Or so I thought. I have since received calls to my mobile every few days. I prefer not to answer calls from unknown numbers, due to the sheer amount of cold-calls I seem to receive (people wanting money in some manner, like this charity who obviously wanted more of it). These unanswered calls continue to this day, almost 3 months on from the original donation.</p><p>What promised to be a quick, easy, ‘no strings’ way to donate, quickly morphed into the typical guilt-ridden process of avoidance. This is the opposite of how one should feel when giving anything to charity.</p><hr /><p>If Apple were to share our contact details (a phone number, postal address, or even just an email) with the developers of every app we download — well, it goes without saying that we would simply cease to download anything.</p><p>I suggest that charities might look at examples like Apple’s App Store as a great example of how to earn people’s pennies painlessly, and more frequently, as well as how to make the process as positive as possible.</p><p>Now, if my text message donation had been the end of my conversation with this charity (and others took up the same offering) my reaction to being stopped in the street would have changed based on that one experience, which would be a vast improvement from the norm.</p><p>However, the App Store model could be taken on in a more direct sense — where one charity takes the lead in setting up a secure system that they use themselves (e.g. Apple’s own apps), and make available for other charities to use. The SMS number could stay the same, with each charity given a unique label, and donors choosing how much to donate.</p><p>An example call to action could then be:</p><blockquote><p>  Text ‘Macmillan £10’ to 88811</p></blockquote><p>No phone number (or other info) would be saved from your donation — this protection of privacy would quickly become public knowledge, and the method trusted. With only one number for everyone to remember, and thus one number for all charities to promote, the frequency of donations would be more likely to increase (if you’re feeling good on payday, why not text an extra £5 to your three favourite charities this week?).</p><hr /><p>Of course, we’re seeing some great modern solutions to fundraising start to emerge — especially in the social arena with services such as the following:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.givey.com">Givey.com</a> — born in the North East, recently receiving $960,000 in funding, Givey encourages fundraising between friends and allows donations via the site, text message, or tweet.</li><li><a href="http://believe.in">Believe.in</a> — a small group of London-based designers and developers, Beleive.in offers people and charities a better way to connect with one another. They want to hire the best people there are, to tackle an industry that has seen little innovation over the last few decades.</li><li><a href="https://pledgeit.org.uk">Pledgeit.org.uk</a> — ran by the team at Leukeamia &amp; Lymphoma Research, Pledegit calls to our mischievous side, by encouraging us to challenge our friends. If enough people sponsor the said challenge, then just how can we say no?</li></ul><p>So, there is certainly positive momentum in the world of social, which is truly great to see. </p><p>I’d simply love to see how this kind of thinking transfers to the charities themselves when communicating on the street, the TV, or through our letterboxes.</p>
