Guidance about design is often situated in other disciplines. In texts about writing, for instance, are wise
words about design. By way of example, some of my favorites follow (I’ve replaced “writing” and its
forms with “[designing]”):

> [Designers] get so fixated on the mechanics of
> [design] that they forget how much they can learn from the other arts about line and the uses of space. Good
> [design], like a good watch, should have no unnecessary parts, and that’s what great art shouts at us: Tell
> the story with no unnecessary parts.

> Zinsser](http://theamericanscholar.org/simple-geometry/)

> I’d
> like to [design] something that comes from things the way wine comes from grapes.
> —[Walter
> Benjamin](http://books.google.com/books?id=jVIwAUqlE10C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false)

> [Designing]—I
> can really only speak to [designing] here—always, always only starts out as shit: an infant of monstrous
> aspect; bawling, ugly, terrible, and it stays terrible for a long, long time (sometimes forever). Unlike
> cooking, for example, where largely edible, if raw, ingredients are assembled, cut, heated, and otherwise
> manipulated into something both digestible and palatable, [designing] is closer to having to reverse-engineer
> a meal out of rotten food.

> [Design]
> to please just one person. If you open a window and make love to the world, so to speak, your [design] will
> get pneumonia.
> —[Kurt
> Vonnegut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut#Self-assessment)

> My
> ignorance is essential. I do not [design] what I know but what I need to know.

> You’re a [designer] — or an artist — or you’re not. It
> sounds harsh, but, seriously, not everyone’s wired for this stupid life. If you think you are, then you have
> to [design] around the block. Anything that takes your fancy. Just get words happening. The rest will follow.
> Best of luck.

> I’m
> not asking you to come reverently or unquestioningly; I’m not asking you to be politically correct or case
> aside your sense of humor (please God you have one). This isn’t a popularity context, it’s not the moral
> Olympics, and it’s not church. But it’s [designing], damn it, not washing the car or putting on eyeliner.
> If you can take it seriously, we can do business. If you can’t or won’t, it’s time for you to close the
> book and do something else.
> Wash the car, maybe.

Try substituting the word “design” for “writing” in any passage, and you may instantly have new words
of wisdom.
