# Empathy is for everyone

It’s been a few weeks since the project started and I’ve been spending all my time getting to know the
users. I’ve listened to them talk about their lives, hopes and fears. I’ve watched them interact with the
digital world and even spied on them a bit. As with every project I work on, I’ve gone to great lengths to
take a walk in their shoes and see the world through their eyes. I do UX and that’s what we UX people do.
Empathy is the name of the UX game. 

After few weeks of research I feel like I’ve known the users all my life. It’s now time for my clients to
get to know them too and what better way to instill a bit of good old empathy than using the art of
storytelling? I invite my clients to a workshop and, armed with research findings and user quotes, I ask them
to help me create a set of stories that will bring the key behaviours of their customers to life. They’re in
and raring to go.

The first step is to create some characters. We start by giving them a name, an age and a job. We then spell
out their hopes and fears, their likes and dislikes. When our characters are done, we write stories about a
day in their life and some snippets about their past and present. Everybody is having fun and by the end of
day they’re all talking about the characters as if they’ve known them forever, as if they were their
friends, family and neighbours. Empathy is in the air and we’re all confident that the project will be a
success. 

The research phase is done and it’s time to start designing. What could go wrong? Well, soon enough, the
characters in our lovingly crafted stories are downgraded from friends to one of those old annoying relatives
that everybody in the family likes to take the piss out of or ignore. Why are my clients even considering
spending most of their budget on a feature that none of our characters cares about? Why do they keep asking us
to copy the homepage of that other website that none of our characters would ever use? And yes Mr Client, I
realise that there is a typo on the wireframe.

Have my clients learnt nothing from the empathy journey I took them on? I seeth in anger at the coldness of
their hearts and with my clenched fist pointed to the sky, I ask WHY to the Gods and curse my clients. But the
curse backfires and like a bolt of cold lightning bounces back and freezes my heart. All my cherished empathy
is drained out of my soul, I look at my client and instead of a human being I see a cartoon villain getting in
the way of my divine quest to save the users. Like a teenager, I sulk and complain to every colleague that
wants to hear about it. I mull about how everything is so terribly unfair and my clients just don’t get it.
I laugh out loud at silly cartoons and jokes about annoying clients and dream of a world where clients don’t
exist.

I could stay like this, cursed, for days, weeks, years, forever, but a word or maybe a memory lights a spark
in my heart and wakes me up from the spell. I remember that my clients have a name, an age and a job; that
they have hopes and fears, likes and dislikes. I take the time to listen to their stories. I go to great
lengths to take a walk in their shoes and see the world through their eyes and I finally begin to understand
the real meaning behind their words.

No matter how many times I go through this journey, it never stops surprising me how easy it is to lose
perspective in the heat of a project and forget that there is no difference between a user, a client and a
designer. It shouldn’t be so hard to remember that no matter the title, we’re all just people trying to
get things done. I write ‘empathy is for everyone’ on a Post-it note, stick it on my monitor and get back
to work.
