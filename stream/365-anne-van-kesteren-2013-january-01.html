       <p>Clay Shirky wrote <a href="http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2012/11/napster-udacity-and-the-academy/">Napster, Udacity, and the Academy</a> the other day. It is well worth reading in its entirety, but let me selectively quote a part that struck me:</p><blockquote>Once you see this pattern—a new story rearranging people’s sense of the possible, with the incumbents the last to know—you see it everywhere. First, the people running the old system don’t notice the change. When they do, they assume it’s minor. Then that it’s a niche. Then a fad. And by the time they understand that the world has actually changed, they’ve squandered most of the time they had to adapt.</blockquote><p>It succinctly captures what I am involved with and see happening in the web standards world. Now for the second time in fact. First we had the decision in 2004 at a W3C Workshop around Web Applications (now referred to as “The Workshop”) to no longer work on HTML and JavaScript, but instead focus on XML. To counter that decision the WHATWG was formed and proved the W3C wrong. The W3C now heralds HTML5 as one of its success stories.</p><p>Now the WHATWG is our new story and it has ably demonstrated that the bureaucracy of the standards process can be circumvented. More became possible, if you will. The second time came when the W3C reaffirmed its stance on a restrictive license for specifications. Specifications belong to anyone. They prove themselves by being in wide use. That combined with the fact that the W3C Process requires editors to do a lot of make work, of which complaints during my seven years there went unaddressed, made me feel my time would be better spent elsewhere.</p>
