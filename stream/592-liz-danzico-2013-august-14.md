# What people who do write do understand

Woody Allen
[recently](http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/woody-allen-0913):

Whenever I find myself in a bout of nonwriting (not writer’s block per se, but an extended period of
nonwritingness), I know it’s this. Not a [lack of
ideas](http://ideas.theatlantic.com/2009/07/interview_with_jack_hitt_part_ii.php), not a lack of the [right
space to write](http://bobulate.com/post/2963123600/a-hotel-room-is-the-perfect-place-to-write-youre), the
[right drink](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jul/20/why-do-writers-drink-alcohol), the [right
order](http://bobulate.com/post/426444664/advice-to-writers), the [right
methods](http://www.writing.upenn.edu/library/Mayer-Bernadette_Experiments.html), the [proper
instrument](https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/8d6e7df7ae58), not a [deficit of
time](https://medium.com/writers-on-writing/99f815014df3). It’s simply my conscious getting in the way. I
would be better off saying things more wildly, then looking at what I’d said. Do first, think later; many
things can benefit from this method — falling in love, taking your first job, speaking up for what you
believe in. Write first, think later. Repeat.
