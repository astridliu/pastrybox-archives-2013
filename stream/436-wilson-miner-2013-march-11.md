My favorite part of any new video game is the tutorial. Let me explain.

One of the magic tricks that good games have to pull off is how to pace complexity. The amount of time a
player spends with any one game is usually pretty long. The low end of gameplay time for big commercial games
is about 8–10 hours, and it’s not hard to spend hundreds of hours with certain games. To keep you
interested for that long, a game has to be relatively complex. But if a game dumps all that complexity on you
in the beginning, you’ll never make it. They have to introduce it gradually.

Games used to do this with separate tutorial levels. Before starting the real game, you’d be strongly
admonished to play the tutorial first, which usually took the form of separate levels with guided steps along
the way to introduce the interface and the core mechanics.

Modern games have started working the tutorials into the first few levels of the real game, sometimes so
deftly that you hardly know you’re playing a tutorial. 

Weaving the tutorial into the first few moments of the game makes for another balancing act. Not only does the
game want to teach you how to play it, it wants you to get a feel for what playing the game is going to be
like for many more hours. It wants you to say: “whoa, this is going to be good.”

In this way, game tutorials have started to behave more like pilot episodes in television. Pilots have a
similar magic trick to pull off. In the first episode they have to introduce the characters and the rules of
their world while at the same time convincing you that this is a place you want to come back to for many more
hours. A pilot is a promise to the viewer: “this is going to be good.”

Some shows are better at fulfilling this promise than others. If you go back and watch the first episodes of
your favorite shows (as I have done more times than I’d like to admit), you can see which ones stuck to the
rules they set out in the beginning and which ones wandered from the path.

In the first episode of one of my favorite shows, The West Wing, there’s a sequence of vignettes that visits
each of the main characters in a moment of their lives. Each one establishes some essential aspect of that
character’s personality and gives you a sense for the role they play in the world of the show. The
remarkable thing about these scenes is that, watching them after spending more than a hundred hours with these
characters, they still ring true. These first sketches of these characters, presented so confidently and
economically in the beginning—each one lasts just a few minutes—was a promise kept for the rest of the
show.

It’s that same confidence and economy that makes a great tutorial for a great game. There are no wrong
choices during the tutorial, and each step forward introduces a core mechanic that you’ll hopefully spend
the rest of the game using. Is this fun? Do I want to get to know these characters? Do I want to spend time in
this world? By the end of a good tutorial or a good pilot episode, you should have your answers.

When we design digital products, for the most part, we’re still building tacked on tutorial modes. Step by
step introductions, a few popups to show you where the important buttons are. Did you get all that? Good,
because now you’re on your own. 

But beyond just instructions, what are the promises we want our products to make? And how do we present them
confidently and economically in the first few moments? How do we get people to say: “whoa, this is going to
be good”?
