    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>I’m all feelings these days. Mushy-smushy, ooey-gooey feelings. I go to a conference and end up at a dinner table with my content strategy colleagues, telling them about the time a particularly dramatic truth-or-dare misstep got me ostracized for the entirety of sixth grade, and how I felt ashamed of the whole thing, still, almost two decades later.</p><p>I finish up a staff planning workshop for <em>A List Apart</em> with bear hugs and text messages full of &lt;3s, sappy as all get-out about working with great people.</p><p>I try to write about my content strategy work—the often very practical stuff I do to help organizations make their content make sense—and I end up with posts about being <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-march-2013/">vulnerable</a>, about <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-july-11/">fear</a>, about <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-september-28/">having a good cry at a conference</a>.</p><p>When’d my work life get so <em>emotional</em>?</p><p>I didn’t intend for that to happen. I thought I’d keep on writing about content modeling and editorial strategy and mobile. I thought I’d take on substantial posts about rolling up my sleeves and <em>figuring things out</em>. But the more I did that work, the more I wanted to write about the other stuff, too— the barriers I ran into trying to get work implemented, the people problems and political reasons that content is so <em>hard</em>.</p><p>And that’s when it started getting squishy. Because the more I explored those things, the more I realized that I couldn’t keep talking about organizations’ messiness unless I was also willing to talk about <em>humans’</em> messiness.</p><p>And this particular human? She’s pretty messy. I forget to listen sometimes. I’m antsy. I’m inconsistent. I’m helpful and supportive—as long as you’re doing the thing I think you ought to. I’m ambitious—so ambitious I sometimes seek out things I don’t even really <em>want</em>.</p><p>I’d love not to admit all that, but I have to now. It’s part of the deal I made with myself this year: if I want people to be honest with me, if I want my client relationships to be based on shared values and actual connection, then I have to bring my whole self—in all my not-quite-right glory—to the table.</p><p>Being real—desperately, painfully, awkwardly real—used to terrify me, but it gets easier the more I do it. People I love and respect the most have even told me that opening up and talking about their struggles with depression and fears of inadequacy and general not-always-having-their-shit-together has led them to their most satisfying work to date.</p><p>That doesn’t mean it’s easy, or that everyone will understand—as my friend Shannon Fisher <a href="http://www.republicofquality.com/courage-in-vulnerability">spoke about at the Dare Conference</a>:</p><blockquote>A friend told my husband he thinks my blog is too much. Inappropriate. This friend runs a company and would be an ideal client for the business I started in January of this year after leaving my nine-year teaching career to pursue different dreams. I had to ask myself if our friend is right—am I too much? ... I talked to a friend about losing clients because of my openness. She said, “Shannon, you’ll have the most success being you.”</blockquote><p>So will I, I think. So will you.</p>
