       <p>I’m out of ideas.</p><p>I’ve been thinking about this post—my last post, my final chance to whip up something fresh before next year’s Pastry Boxers take over—for weeks now. How do I end the year with something suitably Meaningful and Important and Memorable? How do I take these themes I’ve explored all year—themes like <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-march-2013/">empathy</a> and <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-june-10-2/">empowerment</a> and <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-august-27/">letting go of control</a>—and tie them up with a tidy little bow?</p><p>Truth is, I can’t. I’m looking back at a year that was strange and lovely and transformative and absolutely exhausting, and I don’t know what it all means, much less what I want to say next.</p><p>I don’t think I’m the only one.</p><p>I talked with lots of friends and acquaintances this year who wanted to start speaking or writing or working for themselves, but were anxious to take the first step. “Everything I want to talk about, someone has already said—better,” they’d tell me. “Do I really have anything new to add?”</p><p>They were out of ideas.</p><p>I also spoke with friends who were doing high-profile stuff all year—people who wrote books, keynoted conferences, led massive projects, started products. And guess what? They were all anxious, too. They were worried they’d used up their current schtick, and they weren’t sure where to find a new one.</p><p>They were out of ideas.</p><p>We all feel this way sometimes—that we’ve spent our intellectual capital, that we have nothing new to add. Even the smartest, most successful, most dynamic people you know. But it’s a lie. We don’t need a new schtick to say something valuable. We just need to be thoughtful and kind and also critical—willing to take a hard look at our work, our community, and our lives.</p><p>The ideas will come when they’re ready. In the meantime, I’m <a href="http://www.caymanislands.ky/">taking a break</a>.</p>
