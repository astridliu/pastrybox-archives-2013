A mindset.

We live in an overly immersive world; one where the division between what is online versus offline—what is
digital versus physical—is diminishing.

> 
>  *  The kiosk in our local supermarket: online or offline?
>  *  What good is a printed barcode (physical, offline) without something physical to read it, and a digital
> (online) interface to interpret the data into something useful? 

Not only are the lines between these things blurring, they often need to work together seamlessly. 

We live in such a world that it should be becoming harder and harder to label ourselves a *web designer*, or a
*web developer*, or a *digital account manager*. 

> *If you label yourself a ‘web
> designer’, are you saying that you __only__ design for the web? If working for a client, do you only think
> about their website, disregarding the rest of the brand and communications? I’m sure you
> don’t.*

I’d like to suggest that we’re belittling what we do—*everything* that makes up our role—into a two or
three word title. This is often simply for the sake of other people, for the sake of us fitting into a
corporate structure, or even to make it easy to introduce ourselves.

I believe that the only thing that describes the true us is what’s at our *core*; the central part of us
around which all our other talents and interests revolve.

> My core is simply
> *designer*. This is the thing, the part of me, that influences and leads a lot of the other things in my life;
> how I arrange my furniture, the clothes I choose, the films I enjoy.
> Others peoples’ cores could be anything; Engineer, Marketeer, Educator, Artist, Musician, Mathematician.
> Their central interest or passion that leads a lot of the other tangential things they do.
> 

If you take away all of our tools (whether that’s Photoshop, a code editor, a computer), our core should
still remain. We should still be able to look at the world—and solve problems—with our core passion
alone.

> As a Designer, my core would still allow me to be able to *design* a teapot, a
> city’s road layout, or a car’s dashboard. 

Tools and knowledge can be learned. What’s at your core cannot.

Reminding ourselves of who we are at our core makes us far more aware of the opportunities we have available
to us right now but, more importantly, the opportunities we can create for ourselves in the future.

Let your core steer your decisions and plans in life and forget about the obvious, or the mundane. Let
what’s at your core do the thinking for once. It’s what you’re good at…
