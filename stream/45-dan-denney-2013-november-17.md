I am a continual student of CSS techniques and I’ve been writing it on a daily basis for years. However, I
have always struggled with creating my own systems. On top of the fantastic articles that I read weekly, I
also have the benefit of working with [Drew Barontini](https://twitter.com/drewbarontini) and [Nick
Walsh](https://twitter.com/nickawalsh). Luckily, they are naturals at creating systems.

In a recent conversation, something finally clicked and I’m looking at things completely differently. It’s
so simple and obvious, but it really has taken a long time for it to sink in.

My typical thought when approaching an element has been “What do I need to write to style this?”, where
now I’m constantly asking “What can I add to something that exists in order to style this?”.

I’m sure many, maybe even most, of you are already thinking this way. If you’re not, though, give it a
whirl. You’ll become more knowledgeable of your existing codebase and will naturally write in more of a DRY
style.
