       <h1>Trying out a new social app<span style="font-weight:normal;"><em>August 2013</em></span></h1><p>Downloaded a new social app. I heard it was interesting and it seems easy enough to check it out. Went to the app store, downloaded the app and there it is on my iPhone home screen.</p><p>Okay, nice design. Have to sign up or login to continue. Full name, username, email address. Check. Need a photo of me? Okay I guess I can use this one that I took a couple months ago and still have on my phone.</p><p>I wish I had some better photos of myself on my phone. Who ever chooses that option to use the camera RIGHT NOW to take a photo of themselves? Good profile photos take some setup. Duh.</p><p>Now let’s find some friends. Connecting with Twitter or Facebook seems dicey. What if this app tweets or posts on my behalf? Facebook Connect ruined everything.</p><p>I can search for friends using my phone contacts. Cool. Sadly only a few of my phone contacts are using this app. Oh well, I’ll add them all. I wish I had more female friends to share with. It’s weird to have only early adopter dude friends on this app.</p><p>I wish I could invite some friends to use this app. Why can’t I send an email or SMS to invite people? I’m pretty sure Mail and Message functionality is built into iOS.</p><p>Okay, so now I have a few friends on this app. Are they good friends of mine or just casual acquaintances? I wonder how these relationships will affect how I use this app?</p><p>It would be great to be able to refresh my network at some point. Why doesn’t any app do that? Take me through the friend-finding process again after some period of time?</p><p>I’m done playing with the app for now. Closed it out and moved on.</p><p>I wonder if I’ll get a push notification soon so I remember that I have this new app?</p>
