# Three things I have to remind myself

## Trust your reader

The writing you love is warm and clear. Don’t let arguments get in the way of what you want to say. Your
reader’s beside you holding your hand, not across from you or below you.

## Listen to your gut

Ask questions about a project and the people involved before showing up to a meeting. Say no when your stomach
says no. And if your gut isn’t sure when you get there, walking out always feels good when you want to.

## Say thank you

People will lift you up and help you out—even when you’re being a grump. Don’t forget to [say thank
you](http://www.themorningnews.org/article/how-to-write-a-thank-you-note). You don’t have to be clever or
write a novel. You can include a small gift if you want to, but don’t fret over the details so much. It’s
the thought that counts.
