       <p>I’m a thousand feet above Burlington, North Carolina, and out the left window I can see the airport that I intend to land at approximately two minutes from now. My left wingtip points directly at the giant “24” at the end of the runway; the windsock beside the runway says I’ll have a headwind and a slight crosswind from the left when I’m landing.</p><p>Power to 1,800 RPM. Spin the trim wheel three times, and start descending as my airspeed bleeds off to about 80 knots. Flaps 10 degrees. Soon the end of the runway is over my left shoulder. There’s no control tower here; it’s up to me to tell other planes what I’m up to, and it’s up to them to listen.</p><blockquote><p>Burlington traffic, Skyhawk 6026 Sierra, left base runway 24.</p></blockquote><p>I ease the plane into a gentle left-hand turn—not too steep, or things could end quickly and badly—and the nose of the plane moves through 90 degrees. Flaps 20, 70 knots, descending steadily.</p><blockquote><p>Burlington traffic, Skyhawk 6026 Sierra, turning final runway 24.</p></blockquote><p>Another shallow turn, even more careful this time because I’m moving even more slowly through the air and the flaps angled down from the wings make the airplane feel sloppy and sluggish. I roll out of the turn with my nose pointed slightly left of the runway to make up for the crosswind I’m expecting, but a peek at the windsock beside the runway says the breeze has died, and the picture I see out the front window isn’t right; I’m too high.</p><p>Power idle, flaps 30, 65 knots, but not only am I too high, the missing breeze means I’m also moving over the ground faster than I expected and the end of the runway is rapidly approaching, and you might think I could point the nose of the plane down to fix all of this but you’d be wrong because the plane would start moving over the ground even faster while simultaneously descending more slowly.</p><p>Well, shit.</p><blockquote><p>Burlington traffic, Skyhawk 6026 Sierra, short final runway 24, going around.</p></blockquote><p>I’ve practiced this plenty of times, but still. Full power, use all my strength to push the control yoke forward as the plane starts climbing or else I’ll stall the plane and crash into the runway, step on the right rudder pedal to compensate for the sudden change in torque, retract the flaps, but slowly or else I’ll also crash into the runway, edge the plane to the right so if I do crash I won’t crash into the runway or a plane that wasn’t listening and decided to take off even though I was landing. </p><p>And start over.</p><p>Which, as it happens, is the point of this story: sometimes, you do your best to get everything right, and yet you have to start over, and starting over can be damn scary at first. But, as my instructors endlessly impressed upon me during the 60 hours of training that earned me a plastic card that says I am allowed to fly an airplane, there should never be any shame in it—indeed, perhaps the worst thing one could do is to stick with it, and find oneself standing on the brakes as the plane skids off the end of the runway.</p>
