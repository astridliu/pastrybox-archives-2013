       <p>There has been a really interesting shift in the industry for front-end devs. A few years ago, it wasn’t a very popular full-time position. Most likely, markup was handled by back-end devs and/or designers. We had a little boom where front-end dev roles were created and offered all throughout the industry. I feel it was heavily related to the depth of technical knowledge necessary to build sites responsively or specifically for mobile devices. </p><p>The offering hasn’t changed, but the talent pool has. As a very active member of my local communities, people reach out to me fairly often when they are hoping to find people to help them build something. For the last 6 months or so, I’ve mostly shrugged and resorted to tweeting about opportunities that come up. I don’t personally know a front-end dev that isn’t either swamped with work or completely fulfilled with their job.</p><p>I wonder if this is a local problem or an industry-wide problem. My guess is that it is industry-wide because even <a href="https://www.google.com/about/jobs/search/#!t=jo&amp;jid=45098&amp;">Google</a> is actively seeking front-end devs. It is either that there aren’t enough front-end devs out there to fill the demand or that there isn’t enough visibility for them. Things like <a href="http://blog.codepen.io/2013/04/06/hire-me-for-all">CodePen’s hire me button</a> help, but we likely need more ways too. If you’re a front-end dev and you’re looking for work, please make sure people know!  </p>
