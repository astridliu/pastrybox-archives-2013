       <p>We have operating systems, browsers, app markets, and the web. I want to change the world so that the operating system is the browser and its app market the web. I am using this last post to describe this system in a little detail as it is exciting to think about, yet much is still unclear.</p><p>Foremost, everything on the system has a URL. You bookmark <code>https://mail.example.com/</code> to “install” your Example Mail app on your home screen (<code>about:home</code>). Some of these URLs could be built-ins, e.g. <code>about:settings</code> or<code>about:phone</code>, to deal with configuration and legacy applications the web does not really have an interest in supporting natively. After all, with WebRTC we can make <code>https://phone.example.org/</code> happen (and so much more).</p><p>Being able to navigate to these URLs is essential. This allows apps to be integrated with each other in the same way sites are today, using <code>&lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;</code>. On this system apps and sites will be within the same continuum.</p><p>To get there offline will need to work. A flaky network should still give us access to our bookmarked URLs and let us take photos with <code>http://betterphoto.example.com/nightly</code>. We need to get smarter about allocating storage and not prompting the user for it. And since we will be putting the trust with the end-user rather than a centralized app store, we have to get creative about APIs that are today deemed privileged. Can we do a socket API that works for sites? Can we expose Bluetooth? Is exposing a Bluetooth API even sensible on a platform that will likely outlive it?</p><p>That is what I’m working on so one day I can say “Native is dead, long live the native web.”</p>
