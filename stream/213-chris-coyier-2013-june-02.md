It sure is easy to waste time sitting at a computer. I’d list the ways, but you know the ways. Some of that
time is required because we’re decompressing. But some of that time is because we’re being lazy,
procrastinating, or worse, lacking the self-awareness to even realize we’re burning hours.

I don’t have a solution, but I have one little idea. Every time you sit down at the computer, do at least
one thing of significant lasting value. Think through a problem. Write an email that connects with someone.
Design something new or iterate a design that needs it. Help someone. Write something intended for
publication. Work on the digital empire that is you.
