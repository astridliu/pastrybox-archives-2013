After dealing with charts, graphs and data visualisations my opinions have softened. There are so many
‘right’ answers to things it becomes hard to see bad work. Even if I personally dislike a design, a good
designer can back up their reasoning with sound advice and justifications. So what is left is bad design,
built on bad choices. Some of those bad choices are habitual (that’s the way we’ve always done it),
inertia (the tool makes it so easy to create these designs) or ignorance (we had no idea the problems with pie
charts, everyone else uses them, how bad could they really be?). It takes a lifetime of teaching and training
to change all three of these categories, but the designers need to be open to changing. You can never simply
walk in and say, ‘this is crap’. That is the last thing people want to hear about their precious design,
it is their baby, they did the best they could and you just came in and knocked it over. There needs to be a
much better way. Some days I can do it, some days it is hard, but you can never criticise base on your
personal opinions.
