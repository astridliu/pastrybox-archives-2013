       <p>I really like the idea of doing one thing and doing it well.</p><p>I’ll admit that I was one of those people who wanted to learn how to do absolutely everything, but I’m getting much better at controlling where I spend my time and effort. Once upon a time, I wanted to learn Flash, software development, After Effects, 3D modelling—the list went on. It was even difficult for me to drop the “Photographer” title on my business card when I went freelance. But these days, I prefer to focus on illustration and web design only. </p><p>Introducing too many products or services can weaken your brand <em>and</em> the quality of your work if you aren’t careful. </p><p>I remember when I was obsessed with Threadless and had a wish list of t-shirts I was going to buy. These days, I don’t even bother looking at the website. There’s too much stuff—too many contests, too many types of products, and what I think to be too many sub-par designs. Call me picky, but I feel like the overall quality of the basic idea—their t-shirt, has gone downhill over the past couple of years. It doesn’t feel special or exciting anymore.</p><p>Remember the time when there were six versions of Windows Vista, and one version of OS X? Giving customers too many choices can be overwhelming and confusing. If you do it, you’d damn well better make sure you do it right and never allow it to affect the quality.</p><p>I just got back from New York City and noticed the same idea in shops—one of my favourites being One Girl Cookies in Brooklyn. Don’t go there and expect to get a Starbucks-sized menu, because you’re not going to find it. One Girl Cookies is arguably famous for their delicious whoopie pies, and besides their namesake cookies, you might find only one cake option per day. They know what their customers come for, and they do a fantastic job at keeping consistent quality. </p><p>It can feel stressful in a world where designers and developers are expected to know everything about everything. I’m certainly not advising for a designer to not bother learning code, or for a developer to not care about visual details, but try not to lose sight of what really makes you special.</p>
