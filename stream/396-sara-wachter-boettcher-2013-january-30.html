       <h1>Novelty</h1><p>2012 was a weird year. I wrote a book, moved 2,400 miles, started editing a magazine, and gave talks on four continents. I even <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mirka23/8162995694/" title="Me petting a cheetah, by Rachel Lovinger">pet a cheetah</a>. </p><p>But it was also the first year in memory where I didn&#8217;t read novels. </p><p>Oh, I <em>read</em> all right. I downed blog posts and skimmed technical titles. Scoured web-professional articles and tried to keep up with the news. But for most of the year, the closest I got to a work of fiction was hurrying through a short story at the airport. </p><p>Sure, I&#8217;d started <cite>Ada or Ardor</cite>—a sprawling Nabokov tome that reads like a Tolstoy family drama, if old Leo were high on modernity, absurdity, and possibly mescaline—in January. And I was falling in love with it, too, in all its illicit eroticism and decadent allusion. Yet I put it down a third of the way through and never managed to pick it back up.</p><p>This isn&#8217;t like me at all. </p><p>At first, I thought the problem was a lack of work-life balance—that I was spending too much time slaving over projects and paydays, and not enough giving in to curiosity and culture. But the problem wasn&#8217;t just that I was working <em>too much</em> (though I probably was). It was that I&#8217;d cut off my nose to spite my face: In order to make more time for work, I was removing the very things that allowed me to get any <em>good</em> at my work in the first place. </p><p>You see, the truth about the web is that there&#8217;s no inherent <em>there</em> there. The only substance it has is the substance we give it—which means that if we&#8217;re not <em>substantial people</em>—people who&#8217;ve read far and wide, thought long and hard, and discovered what it is that matters—then the web work we&#8217;re capable of will always be shallow. </p><p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I love my work. I love thinking about users, helping organizations get more realistic about publishing, and making content memorable. I love my clients. I love writing about and working on the web. Most of all, I love the array of super-smart people I&#8217;ve had the chance to meet, work with, and learn from along the way. But if we don&#8217;t explore the rest of the world—if we don&#8217;t get outside our work and wander into whatever weird corners we fancy—we&#8217;ll never be able to give our work <em>life</em>. We&#8217;ll have a slew of &#8220;best practices,&#8221; but nothing worth practicing. </p><p>It&#8217;s not just about reading novels, of course. It&#8217;s about living fully—about experiencing the world in all its complexity and exposing yourself to ideas that are foreign and challenging. It&#8217;s about getting constant practice at thinking critically and connecting disparate concepts. It&#8217;s about building interesting things because you&#8217;re an interesting person. </p><p>So this year, I&#8217;m not giving all my attention to the endless novelty of web work. I&#8217;m making space for a Nabokov novel. </p>
