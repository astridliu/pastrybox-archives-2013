This is an excerpt from [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk)â€™s [assisted digital
policy](http://publications.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/digital/assisted/):

> Assisted digital
> is the help government will give to ensure that we do not exclude any users of government services (whether
> citizens or businesses) who are not online. The Digital Landscape Research shows that 18% of UK adults are
> offline (defined as rarely or never being online). 82% of people are online (defined as regularly or
> occasionally using the internet) but some have lower digital skills and may need help, at least initially, to
> use digital services.

This kind of service is increasingly needed not only when people struggle to access the online web services we
build, but also if (well, *when*) the services themselves go down. Over in the U.S., when the health insurance
exchanges launched this month, the websites faced a host of issues. The application counselors who staffed
physical locations across the country suddenly became the only means for people to apply.

Who worked on designing the user experience for *that*?
