I just went to [Confab London](http://confabevents.com/events/london-2013), a conference where people from 28+
countries come to shake hands, sip cocktails, and listen to each other’s experiences in the web
industry.

While Confab is made for people who work on content and communications, everyone’s welcome. The environment
is so welcoming that it kind of makes Twitter feel like a mosh pit or an overcrowded shopping mall. We shove
and shout, and every now and again things get so ugly we need a professional timeout. This kind of aggression
leaves me with questions:

 *  How can we show empathy for other people in the field? What assumptions can we make about our peers?

 *  When something new launches, what kinds of responses are appropriate? Is it always the best or worst thing
ever?

 *  If something is broken or needs work, how can we tell someone that can do something about it?

 *  If we dislike a design in 140 characters, are we teaching clients to judge based on personal taste?

 *  If we’re unhappy with a customer service representative, should we shout about it to friends on
Twitter?

I’m not sure where the lines are here, and we’re all figuring it out as we go. I mess up a lot. But if we
give strangers the same kind of respect that we give clients, we might learn more from each other along the
way.
