I give about forty talks a year, at events of varying sizes. Organizing a conference is hard work, and I have
enormous respect for the people who ask me to speak at their events. I’m grateful for the opportunity.

Over the years, I’ve learned to ask a few questions directly so there aren’t any hidden assumptions or
last-minute surprises. Knowing the answers to these questions before I accept the responsibility ensures that
I can do my best work for the organizers and the attendees.

 *  __Will you expect me to provide a copy of my slides in any format other than PDF?__

*Why I’m asking:*I’m happy to provide my slides to be shared with conference participants. PDF is the
easiest way to provide them, and most conference organizers are satisfied with this approach. Occasionally,
however, they’ll ask for the native file. I use Keynote and some custom fonts, so if they want the native
file I need to make sure they understand what they’re getting. I cannot provide my slides in PowerPoint, as
I don’t use that application. Converting between Keynote and Powerpoint is messy and the layouts break, and
for me to rebuild the slides in PowerPoint would take hours.

I won’t speak at events that require me to provide my slides in PowerPoint format.

 *  __Will you expect me to use your template for my slides? If you require that I include your branding on my
slides, is it acceptable to include it only on the closing slide or opening slide?__

*Why I’m asking:*My slide template has been developed over many years, and contains about 25 master slides
with a color palette, typography, and custom builds I’ve lovingly honed. The “template” I get from most
conferences includes a title slide and a body slide with two levels of bullet points. In Arial. I want to give
the best talk I can, which means I can’t redesign my entire presentation using someone else’s template. If
all they require is that I include their logo, the closing “thank you” slide is the easiest place to do
so. Next best is an opening slide that I can put before my title slide.

I won’t speak at events that expect me to use their template for anything other than the opening and/or
closing slide.

 *  __Will I be presenting from my own computer?__

*Why I’m asking:*Sometimes a conference organizer wants to run all the presentations off the same laptop, to
speed the transition time between presenters. Often when they ask for the slides in a specific native format,
that’s what they’re planning. I find this… nervewracking. I know my layouts, builds, and fonts will
render properly on my machine. I know how my presentation remote works and I don’t fear clicking the wrong
button. Using another laptop and another clicker adds an element of risk to a situation where I’d like to be
totally in control. 

I won’t speak at events that won’t let me use my own laptop.

 *  __Will I be able to see the presenter display from the stage?__

*Why I’m asking:*I don’t rely on presenter notes when I’m speaking, but I do need to see the next slide.
I know many other presenters who must have their notes visible—it’s the most experienced speakers who
insist on having them. The setup for some events places the laptop at the back of the room. A monitor visible
from the stage shows the slide the audience sees, but not the presenter display. Usually this is motivated by
a desire to have a completely bare stage. While I love the freedom to move around on stage, unencumbered by
furniture, I *need* my presenter display. Often I don’t find out about this setup until the day of the
event, giving me agita before I get up to perform.

I won’t speak at events that can’t work out an AV setup to show the presenter display from the
stage.

 *  __Will I be expected to take Q&A directly from the audience?__

*Why I’m asking:*I have hearing loss and I wear hearing aids. Taking questions from the audience in a large
room—whether a roving microphone is provided or not—is challenging for me. I struggle to hear the question
and often must ask the attendee to repeat him or herself, and I still might not fully understand. I exit the
stage on a flat and somewhat embarrassing note—the opposite of how I’d like to end my talk. The best
option for me is simply to not take questions, but I also know that attendees value this interaction with the
speaker. The next best alternative is for an emcee to repeat the question so that I (and everyone else in the
audience) can hear it.

I won’t speak at conferences that expect me to take questions directly from the floor, without a moderator
to ensure I hear the question accurately.

It’s my job to make sure I can give the best talk possible at an event. It’s also my job to ensure I ask
the right questions and set myself up for success. If I decline to speak at an event because the setup
does’t work for me, it’s not because I’m a prima donna who requires white roses and no brown M&Ms in
my dressing room. It’s because I’m taking responsibility for what I need to give a great talk.
