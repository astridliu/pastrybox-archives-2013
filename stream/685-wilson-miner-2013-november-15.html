       <p>One of my favorite things about building things is taking things apart. View Source was the only way I ever learned how to build anything on the web. Taking anything apart and trying to put it back together (or build something else with the pieces) is a great way to understand the thought process that goes into making something in the first place. Instead of learning about individual pieces in isolation and then working out how they might fit together, you start with the complete system and work your way backwards. It’s like learning to swim by getting thrown in the deep end of the pool. It can be messy and overwhelming, but once you get it, it sticks.</p><p>As I’ve spent more time designing native interfaces and relatively less time with the web, it’s gotten harder for me to reverse engineer how other people have built things by taking them apart. Even when people do go to the trouble of sharing some process stories after a project is released, or release some reusable pieces of code to the community, it’s not the same as being able to crack open the whole machine and figure out how it ticks.</p><p>I miss being able to dismantle things I love to learn how to build things I don’t know how to make yet.</p>
