       <p>Here&#8217;s my recipe for garlic bread: I make a thick, pungent paste out of minced garlic, softened unsalted butter, extra virgin olive oil, red pepper flakes, grated parmesan cheese, coarse black pepper, and kosher salt, and spread it liberally onto a split loaf of local ciabatta. Then I place it into a 450Â°F oven for about 10 minutes, until it&#8217;s just browned around the edges and studded with roasted garlic bits. It&#8217;s delicious.</p><p>I first started making garlic bread when I was a kid, maybe 10 years old. In fact, it&#8217;s one of the first things I remember cooking by myself. Here was my method back then: I took whatever ancient jar of garlic powder my mom had stashed in the spice cabinet, mixed it with some microwave-melted butter, poured it onto white bread (cut into triangles with the crusts removed for presentation; I wasn&#8217;t a savage), put it into an indiscriminately hot oven, and made sure it didn&#8217;t burn. Back then, I thought that was delicious too.</p><p>Comparing the two, they&#8217;re barely the same food, and I can&#8217;t imagine eating (or forcing someone else to eat) my childhood garlic bread today. But what&#8217;s strange is, it feels to me like I&#8217;ve been making garlic bread the same way for the last 20 years. Why? I guess it&#8217;s because I never really made any major leaps in technique; every change I made over the years was small. At some point I replaced the garlic powder with garlic from a jar, then started mincing my own. I swapped the white bread with Italian bread, then a baguette, then ciabatta. I introduced the olive oil. I added complementary flavors one by one, and removed ingredients that didn&#8217;t quite work (looking at you, rosemary). I may have even gone backward a time or two, reverting to previously abandoned methods. It was a constant, iterative path from my immature proto-garlic bread to my modern, sophisticated garlic bread.</p><p>Enough about garlic bread; let&#8217;s talk about web design. We work in an industry where change happens at a breakneck pace. What&#8217;s true today may not have been true six months ago or even six weeks ago. The internet is a juggernaut, and we&#8217;re all powerless to stop it. But design is different. It progresses at its own pace, and it&#8217;s not always fast. Sometimes design happens deliberately, glacially, almost imperceptibly. Sometimes, you might not even know you&#8217;re designing.</p>
