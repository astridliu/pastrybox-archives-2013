It’s mid-February as I write this thought. Two weeks ago, I made one of the most difficult decisions of my
life, but one I’d been thinking about for a long time—I quit my job. 

I quit my job at a small advertising agency where I was an Art Director and Designer for nearly five years.
I’m leaving a steady paycheck behind and learning how to fend for myself. Truthfully, it’s taken me nearly
two years to build up enough confidence to hand in my notice—I’ve never really considered myself much of a
risk taker. 

It’s now time to focus on me for a while. I’ll be spending the month of March writing a small book and
working on my new portfolio.

It’s my turn to call the shots around here, and I can’t wait to see what happens.
