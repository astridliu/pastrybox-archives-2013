*At some point in your career, this will become relevant:*

At the very least:

 *  Don’t pull up the ladder.

 *  Acknowledge that a ladder existed.

 *  Don’t mock those on the ladder after you.

When you can:

 *  Point out ladders to others.

 *  Study some ladders.

 *  Make better and more ladders.
