       <p>Like a good boy scout, I’ve spent most of my life going out of my way to be prepared. Before I could start a new project, or leave on a trip, or sometimes just leave the house, I instinctively started running through worst-case scenarios and tried to make sure I was prepared for them. Delays, weather, miscommunications, conflicts, anything I could preemptively turn from an unforeseen problem into a solved one. But the dark side of trying to prepare for every situation (besides spending a lot of unnecessary anxiety on situations that never happened) is that when I did run into a truly unexpected situation, I was immediately aware that I was not prepared for it, and that was often paralyzing. Instead of responding to the situation and improvising with whatever was available, I just froze in the realization that I had not prepared for this.</p><p>Becoming a parent for the first time is slowly unraveling my lifelong obsession with preparedness. Before my son was born, I had to get comfortable with the fact that I had no idea what to expect. Like so many others, from the first moment we became parents, my wife and I have had to react and respond to situations we aren’t prepared for. We can’t possibly anticipate every situation, and even if we could, there’s no way we could prepare for them all. Every parent is a MacGyver in training. We just have to respond to the situation and improvise with whatever is available. Slowly, I’m getting used to being unprepared.</p>
