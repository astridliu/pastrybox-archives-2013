“You need to remember that problem-solving and consulting aren’t the same thing.” 

I’d just had a tough conversation about a client project when a mentor of mine said this to me a few months
ago. And I knew immediately what she meant. I’d been so caught up in the fact that I saw what this
organization was doing wrong—why their website had become a dumping ground, where they needed to change
their processes, what they should be focusing on—that I could have sat down and diagrammed a tidy little
flow chart right there. And yet, my client wasn’t happy. 

Specifically, my client wasn’t happy with *me*.

Like getting pushed from behind or dumped on prom night, I hadn’t seen this coming. I had the answers, after
all. I was solving the Big Problems, problems that others didn’t have the tools to untangle, problems others
had struggled with for years. 

Only I hadn’t spent enough time listening to make my client feel heard. I hadn’t made them part of the
solution. So there my client was, feeling overwhelmed and left behind, while I was patting myself on the back.


It’s difficult to solve complex problems, and I’m proud that I’ve amassed the specialized knowledge to
do so. But as hard as it was to get here, I’ve become convinced the next step is much harder: learning to
shut my trap long enough to guide people to solve those problems *for themselves*. 

We’ve been talking a lot about ceding control recently—about accepting, finally, the “ebb and flow of
things” on the web, as [John Allsopp called us to do](http://alistapart.com/article/dao) more than a dozen
years ago. This applies to how we design, sure—to the way we deal with varied devices, screens, and
capabilities. But I think it applies far beyond as well.  

Whether we’re talking about fluctuating screen sizes or flip-flopping executive stakeholders, it’s the
same thing: my control is limited. I’m one person, one project, one input. I’m no mastermind. 

My perfect model means nothing in an organization that doesn’t care, doesn’t understand it, isn’t ready
for it, or can’t implement it. I’m not creating something perfect and finished. I’m participating in
something that’s continually evolving, with or without me. 

Trying to control things doesn’t make my work more significant, frustrating as that may be. It actually
makes it less so. 

I’ve [written](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-july-11/)
[before](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-june-10-2/) about how I’ve been
trying to stop fixing and start facilitating change, trying to help organizations through the shifts that our
work necessitates. 

That conversation was a humbling reminder of how difficult that actually is. 

Masterminding is a myth, a lie that encourages egos and makes us whine when we don’t get our way. It tells
us that *we* are brilliant, and it’s just those terrible *others* who are always ruining things. It’s an
easy story to tell ourselves, this us-versus-them trope. But it’s not how the real work gets done.
