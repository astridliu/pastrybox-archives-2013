I tweeted earlier this month:

Frustrated by my limits all-round: cycling, bouldering, design/dev. Trying to break through to the other side.
This is progress, growth.

As with anything I love doing, I struggle with plateaus. When you reach that point, it can be frustrating,
hard and demoralizing to not see forward movement — the progress that demarcates “leveling up.”

For me, it’s a combination of discipline, practice and a stubborn commitment to forge ahead when these
bottlenecks happen. Just by trying, trying again or by coming back to the problem over and over, can I finally
push on through. 

It’s first-time-you-ask-a-girl-out awkward or first-time-you-ride-a-bike clumsy, but I soldier on anyway and
get a result. It may not be the cleanest line I take, but I get there in the end. Now I know how I can do it
better the next time, breaking that block. 

When a plateau rears its ugly head, ultimately I know I can chop it right off. 

*Note:* Like this article. I wrote this five different ways, with varying iterations. At times, I considered
scrapping and abandoning this article, but in the spirit of its content, I pushed through and ate my own dog
food. I’m not sure I have the outcome I want, or if it’s even good, but this is the best version that
resulted. Next time, then.
