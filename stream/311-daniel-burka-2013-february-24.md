A product designer looks at a reasonably complex problem. A family living in San Francisco wants to visit
their grandmother in Los Angeles. Los Angeles is about 400 miles away, there are some high hills along the
route, and traffic is quite unpredictable at several choke points.

The product designer anticipates all of the variables, maps them out, and comes up with the ideal solution. I
know! We’ll build an F35 Joint Strike Fighter.

The F35 is the most technologically advanced aircraft to date. It can take off from the family’s driveway
using vertical thrust and land just outside grandma’s in LA on a short stretch of road. It can traverse the
distance in twenty-five minutes with the afterburners on full. It has the most advanced navigational system,
so the family can’t get lost en route. And, I know it’s a little harder to fly, but we’ll put extra fuel
tanks under the wings — if the mom changes her mind and chooses to go to Ecuador, the family could do that
too.

Even if the product designer is able to get a great F35 built on time and on schedule, unfortunately it’s
going to take two years to teach mom and dad to get the plane to Los Angeles in twenty-five minutes. No matter
how hard the interface designer designs or a user researcher researches, the inherent complexity can only be
relatively reduced.

The obvious alternative is to build a station wagon. It’s a reliable, tried-and-true vehicle. Many station
wagons have traversed from SF to LA quite successfully. Plus, there’s certainly room to improve upon the
station wagon and build a wonderful variation. A few years ago Lamborghini even manufactured a station wagon
with an impressive V12 engine that could cut an hour off the commute (provided the family could afford the
speeding tickets). It would be a great accomplishment to build the world's best station wagon.

But! A truly inspired product designer will make a teleporter. With no training whatsoever, the family steps
through a portal and appears on grandma’s stoop moments later.
