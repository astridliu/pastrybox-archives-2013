As much of the industry has continued to talk about change and developing product incubators, we’re doing
it, and we’re growing doing it. In 2012, we grew both our team and our revenue, and we did it with a 50/50
split between communications projects and product work. We’ve kept our non-siloed and autonomous culture
thriving, and this year we’re more certain than ever that the best brands are useful and have purpose, and
the most effective products must tell stories.
