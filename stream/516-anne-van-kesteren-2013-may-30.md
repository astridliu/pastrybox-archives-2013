Via [programming is terrible](http://programmingisterrible.com/ ) I stumbled upon [You and Your Research by
Richard Hamming](http://programmingisterrible.com/post/50408804657/you-and-your-research). I read through the
transcript (great read overall) and while I’m not a scientist, I do wonder, what are the really important
problems on the web?

Patents obviously. Unfortunately no attack scenario for those. No attack scenario for increased government
interference either.

Mobile maybe. Although mobile more seems like a big opportunity than a problem per se. We need to get offline
to work, keep pushing performance, introduce more features to enable applications to work without walled
gardens, etc. And of course site developers need to stop being silly about mobile and make sites just work. No
endless redirects that lose track of your target page, no “install app” spam, no plugins, you know.

Parallel computing. It seems like we will get ever more cores, yet most of the web platform is a
single-threaded operation. Workers exists, but we need to do more.

Would love to learn what other people think the really important problems are.
