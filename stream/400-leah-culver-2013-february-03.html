       <p>I don&#8217;t believe in talent. I believe that passion combined with hard work produces results. But how does one find what they&#8217;re passionate about?</p><p>Some people are lucky to find what they love to do when they&#8217;re young. I tried all kinds of activities when I was a teenager. I took piano lessons. I learned to sew and knit. I played soccer, softball, lacrosse, and ran track. I studied French and wrote short stories. However, none of these felt like my true passion.</p><p>I went to college to study design. I had always loved making things and I was excited to find the medium I would like best. Painting? Pottery? Photography?</p><p>I would have never guessed programming.</p><p>I took my first Computer Science class my freshman year. It quickly became my favorite class and I spent many hours building a game for my final project. I was hooked.</p><p>I&#8217;ve been writing code for eleven years now and I&#8217;ve probably long passed the 10,000 hours for mastery according to Malcolm Gladwell. By all accounts I&#8217;m a good programmer now.</p><p>Yet today I woke up early to work on a juicy programming problem. I still get excited to make things with code. I&#8217;ve found what I love to do.</p><p>I hope you don&#8217;t buy into the idea that people are naturally good at something or are born talented. Instead, I hope you will find what you love to do. I hope you find your passion.</p>
