       <p>I work a lot with data, data mining, network diagrams and visualisations. One day it struck me as I watched someone in Central London get onto a bus with their luggage, this is a massive network of loosely joined pieces. The bus company runs what is best for them, the airport runs what works for them, taxi services fill holes where it is too far to walk. All these tiny services all pieced together create a vast network which covers just about ever square meter of this globe. Those London busses are on a constant move, looping around like little ants following a trail, sometimes one right after the other. To see a person get on a bus with a suitcase would seem like a strange event by itself, but in my head I knew that bus would get her one step closer to her destination. It might be 2-3 more busses, trains, tubes or taxis to get to that airport, but society has created a massive, unstructured, organic transport network that any citizen can take advantage of. What does our future hold as we make the jump from loosely joined physical transportation networks, to more loosely joined digital ones?</p>
