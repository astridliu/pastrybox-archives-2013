# United States as Platform

*We live in a world system increasingly characterized by illicit networks of criminal and political power that
foster Crime as a Service or Terror as a Service. As such, what would the United States look like as a
provider of Liberty As Service?* 

The connected, fragmented, evermore complex world makes efforts to “control” outcomes through predictive
policy controls—in a centralized way—extraordinarily difficult. It seems policy could take on a more
modern approach through design principles and global platform access.

How might the international policy of the United States change if we conceived of the United States not so
much as a nation, but as a global platform for services to an international community of countries, people,
and institutions? What does it mean to be a platform for liberty in the 21st Century? 

While the United States is not a platform in the software sense, it does have powerful platform
capacities—from its global military and humanitarian reach to its global institutions of finance and
learning, to its relationships to global communities throughout the world. Could we secure benefit by framing
these capacities in broader platform terms?

If we imagined the global platform more expressly through liberal platform concepts like freedom of religion,
freedom of choice, freedom of expression, freedom of commerce; or more generally openness, interoperability,
fairness, self-determination, and economic opportunity, we could secure and evolve sustainable benefits to
ourselves and our nation. One would have to believe that by securing these benefits to a global participating
system of people, institutions, and governments, there would be a net benefit to what we currently think of as
the nation. 

To guide our security and prosperity, we need to identify design principles that improve the reach and
usefulness of the United States as Platform measured as user benefits: openness, interoperability,
self-determination, and economic opportunity for global participants with the United States.

It seems worthwhile to imagine our policy system in this way given the likely shape of the networked future of
the world: The United States as Platform.
