It’s very easy to announce that you’re going to do something. Be wary of announcing what you will do, and
make a point instead of celebrating what you have done. When you’re planning and plotting, that’s not the
time for pronouncements or fanfare about the great work you’re going to unveil sometime in the future. Save
it for when there’s something to see. It will be all the more impressive if people don’t see it
coming.
