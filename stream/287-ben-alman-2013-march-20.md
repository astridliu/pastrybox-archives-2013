# Whistlepig vs Bulleit

So this weekend, my wife and I went to Five Horses Tavern in Davis Square, which is where we go to either try
out a new Whiskey or eat the most super-amazing Brussels Sprouts appetizer known to cuisine. Or both. This
time, it was both.

Based on a friend’s recommendation, we ordered the Whistlepig rye. Well, she ordered the Whistlepig. I
ordered the Sazerac rye, because I’ve been meaning to try that—the previous time I ordered a Sazerac, the
waitress brought me a mixed drink, apparently it’s both a rye and a cocktail, whoops—but they didn’t
have it (!) so I went with my fall-back, Bulleit bourbon. Neat (of course).

You can’t go wrong with the Bulleit. It’s good tasting, fairly inexpensive and most places I’ve been to
have it. I took a sip. Tried-and-true delivers, yet again.

Then I cleansed my palate with a sip of water and tried the Whistlepig.

Wow, that’s some good stuff. Flavorful, complex, and so smooth. Let me tell you that after trying the
Whistlepig, it was pretty difficult to go back to the Bulleit. I mean, the Bulleit is good, but the Whistlepig
is great. In some ways, it reminded me of my personal favorite, the Macallan 17 year scotch, but with a bit
more bourbon “burn” up front.

At this point, after having realized that my drink had been hopelessly outclassed, the only option remaining
was to slam my Bulleit, drink an entire glass of water, and try to sneak some more of my wife’s Whistlepig.
Like, “Hey, is that so-and-so over there?” (sneak a sip while she turns around) “Oh, I guess not, it’s
really dim in here, sorry.”

That was Friday night, we bought a bottle of Whistlepig on Saturday.
