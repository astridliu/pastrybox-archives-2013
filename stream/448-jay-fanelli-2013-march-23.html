       <h1>The Product Is Almost More Important Than The Process: A Cautionary Tale About Client Expectations, Communication Gaps, And What Happens When Things Slip Through The Cracks.</h1><p>I’m buying a new car (a 2013 Mini Countryman S, thanks for asking). Actually, it’s more accurate to say that I’m <em>trying</em> to buy a new car. You see, I went to my local Mini dealership with a very clear idea of what I wanted and what I had to spend, and came to an agreement on a new car…and yet here I am more than two weeks later, still driving my 6-year-old Volkswagen with no clear timeframe of when that’ll change. So what happened?</p><p>Not so fast. First, let’s look at the process of buying a car. Buying a car follows a relatively predictable arc. You do your research, you find a model you like, you go to the dealership, you test drive a car or two, you decide on features, you work out financing. Hopefully they have your car on the lot, and you drive it home. If not, they find one at another dealer and get it there in a few days. That’s how it’s supposed to work. Worst case scenario, this takes a week. At least this was my expectation.</p><p>Got it? OK. Now let’s look at the process of selling a car. Selling a car is a lot like fishing. A fisherman casts his bait, waits for a nibble, sets the hook, and reels the fish in. <em>Quickly</em>. Once the fisherman senses a hint of commitment, there’s tremendous urgency to the process. The point is, once a buyer is ready to buy, the salesperson needs to <em>close the deal</em>. There are tens of thousands of dollars at stake in a car purchase and fierce competition for those dollars. It’s not much of a stretch to say that sales people need to sell cars to stay alive. At least this was my expectation.</p><p>Now that we’re all on the same page, here’s what actually happened (the names have been changed to protect the innocent):</p><p><strong>Monday, March 4:</strong> I enter Mini of Pittsburgh at approximately 9:30am with a mission: I am going to buy a 2013 Mini Countryman S. I know what colors I like. I know what features I care about. I know what I can afford. I know what my trade-in is worth. I know what other cars I’m considering. <em>I am ready to swallow the bait. I am ready to be reeled in</em>.</p><p>I am greeted by Justin, my salesman. Justin is a bald, spectacled, stubbly fellow, not unlike myself. Justin compliments my jacket. I like Justin. Justin and I sit down to discuss features. Justin and I test drive a few models. Justin and I return to the dealership to talk business. Justin introduces me to Carl, the sales manager. Carl and I come to an agreement on payments. Carl has me fill out a credit application. Justin and Carl and I shake hands. I leave the dealership, confident I’ll soon be driving a new 2013 Mini Countryman S.</p><p><strong>Tuesday, March 5:</strong> Good news! My credit has been approved. Bad news! My desired vehicle is not in the dealership’s inventory, so they’ll need to locate one. A “locate,” that’s what they call it. I am led to believe that a locate takes a few hours, maybe a day, and from that point it’s another 10–14 days before the car actually arrives. Hmm.</p><p><strong>Wednesday, March 6:</strong> Justin emails me to say that they’ve found a few vehicles that match my desired car. They’re “moving forward with the locate.”</p><p><strong>Thursday, March 7:</strong> I call Justin, inquiring on the status of my locate. “I’m pretty sure we got one,” he says. “Pretty sure?” I ask. “Pretty sure,” he says. I am not so sure. Justin says he’ll call me the next day.</p><p><strong>Friday, March 8:</strong> Justin does not call me.</p><p><strong>Saturday, March 9:</strong> My wife and I visit the dealership unannounced. Justin is busy with other customers, so we pass the time by taking another test drive. Upon our return, we bump into Carl. Carl barely recognizes me. I jog his memory. Carl asks if they ever located my car. “You tell me,” I say. (SPOILER ALERT: they never located my car.) We sit down in Carl’s office to properly locate my car. He gives me three options; I choose one at a Mini dealership in Louisville, Kentucky. “You’re in luck. I know the sales manager in Louisville,” Carl says. Carl is confident he’ll have news for me by the end of the day. The end of the day passes. I hear nothing from Carl.</p><p><strong>Monday, March 11:</strong> It’s midday. I have still heard nothing from Carl. I email him. Carl replies that he has no news, but a few hours later, he emails again. “I got it!!” he writes, with double exclamation points. “Great!!” I reply, with double exclamation points, “do you need anything from me to make it official?” Carl does not respond.</p><p><strong>Tuesday, March 12:</strong> Justin calls to confirm that yes, the locate has been completed, and no, they don’t need anything further from me. I ask if he knows when my car will be picked up. He does not. I ask if he knows the route of the truck picking up my car. He does not. I ask if he’s in contact with the truck driver. He is not. (SIDENOTE: it’s 20-goddamn-13. This truck should be a real-time dot on a map, but I digress.) All Justin knows is that my 2013 Mini Countryman S will be here in 10–14 days and that once it arrives I will be “the second person to know.” He’ll be the first, you see.</p><p>[Eight days pass]</p><p><strong>Wednesday, March 20:</strong> The phone rings early in the morning. I recognize the number; it’s Mini of Pittsburgh. I answer, breathlessly anticipating what is no doubt news of my car’s arrival. Instead, it’s Justin “just checking in,” telling me the same thing he told me eight days ago: yes, my car’s still definitely on the way, and no, he still doesn’t know when, and no, he still doesn’t know if it’s been picked up yet, and no, he still doesn’t know where the truck is. But as soon as it arrives, I’ll be the second to know.</p><p>So now you’re all caught up. One of these days—who knows when, certainly not Justin—I’ll receive a call that my car has arrived. And when that day finally comes, I’ll drop what I’m doing and drive to the dealership and shake everyone’s hand and sign a stack of papers and write someone a check and give them the keys to my Volkswagen and get my new keys and drive my new car home. I’ll be elated. Three months from that day, I’ll probably still be elated, and all that elation for my new car will almost be enough to make me forget about the runaround and lack of communication and dropped balls and interminable wait that I had to endure to get it. Almost.</p><p>What’s the difference between buying a car, or enjoying the process of buying a car? “Almost” is the difference. “Almost” means that I might not recommend my Mini dealership to a friend. “Almost” means that if I had a stronger constitution, I’d tell Justin and Carl to go pound sand while I bought a competitor’s car. “Almost” means that I might not go back a few years from now and buy another Mini. “Almost” is the difference between a customer and a customer-for-life.</p><p>But we’ll see about all that. For now, I wait. My new car is “almost” here.</p>
