If being a part of this industry has taught me anything, it’s that small decisions aren’t made by
entire companies. It’s easy to shake our collective fists at the foibles of monoliths like Google or
Twitter or Instagram, but the reality is that none of them are monolithic. That new feature you’re
trashing was likely designed and developed by a small handful of people sitting together at a table trying to
make the best decision they’re capable of…and those people are listening (and so is everyone else).
Remember that the next time you take to the Internet to let off a little steam. You may think you’re
standing outside the building, harmlessly yelling at the front door, but you’re really standing next to
someone’s desk embarrassing them in front of their colleagues.
