My old man taught me to cook back when I was a kid. I’ve been a vegetarian my whole life, so it was largely
a matter of survival in my household. Plus, Ma can’t cook to save her life. Sorry, Ma.

My father, though, was a great cook. I figured he was just naturally good at it; I mean, the guy could do a
lot of things. I never questioned it until a couple of years ago, watching a French cooking show; they
“finished” a sauce by swirling in a few pats of butter. “Beurre monté,” they called it. I’d done
that—the butter acts as an emulsifier, when you get it right. I knew that the butter had to be added cold,
and I knew the temperature had to be hot enough that it melted fast, but low enough that it wouldn’t
“break.” I did not know that it was, like, a thing with accent marks and whatnot.

It turned out that my father had learned how to cook from my great-grandmother’s boyfriend of decades, Tom.
Tom was a classically trained French chef—I guess he was pretty famous around Boston, back in the day. My
father never really learned the vocab or it just never stuck with him, but he didn’t teach it to me because
he didn’t know it himself. He just knew how cooking worked.

They say you don’t really know something unless you can explain it, but I’m not sure that’s always
completely true. Then again, I’m a vegetarian, so I can’t eat most of what I make anyway. For all I know,
I’m a lousy cook.
