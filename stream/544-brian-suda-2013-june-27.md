We tend to think that there is little innovation in the field of atomic charts and graphs. Sure, we see new
data visualizations and infographics shared around all the time, but no one ever thinks about a new chart
type. We’ve covered all the bases right? Line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts etc. These are
all the options in Excel and have always existed. That’s not true. The pie chart had to be invented, just
like the bar chart. There was a world, pre-line graph. Looking back at history we only remember and use the
winners, all the other charts and graphs that didn’t make sense have fallen by the way side. Even today, new
chart types are always being invented, the stream graph, tree map, horizon graph… all are new and not widely
known about. They aren’t an option in your chart software (yet). So it certainly seems like no new chart
types have been invented, therefore it doesn’t seem like there is much innovation, but that’s far from the
case. All these new chart types will be tried, tested and many will fail, not because they are bad (well some
are), but more likely they fill such a small niche they never get popular support or traction. This is why
when we look around we don’t see new atomic chart types all the time, they just aren’t useful in every day
examples or if they are, the practitioners haven’t started using them enough yet. There is plenty of
innovation and plenty of failures. If you look hard enough, you’ll find them.
