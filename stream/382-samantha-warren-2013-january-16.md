Marketing websites: we have all made them. They’re the online version of a brochure, better than a PDF
download but not quite something that supports a dynamic flow of content. An easy win from the perspective of
a design agency or freelancer; there isn’t a ton of backend tech, they are predictable in scope, and
produce understandable metrics. Not only can we create a known set of deliverables, we are nearly guaranteed
that they will need a new redesign in 2-3 years (bonus, more business!).

But, who the hell makes decisions about what they buy solely based on a marketing website? How much time do
you spend browsing product marketing sites each week? Whether it’s choosing a restaurant or buying a
car, I rarely observe influences in behavior based only on static marketing lingo on a website. Instead, I
believe people spend their time online where they connect with other people or find transparent data.

Frequently I see people making decisions based on word of mouth, too. Whether it be from a trusted friend or
an anonymous rating, people tend to value the sentiment of a third-party far above that of manicured
communications. In the project discovery process I have heard some refer to this as a “social media
component” or making a site “sharable”, but I loathe that terminology. Rather than getting
inventive in how we facilitate this conversation we just sell our clients the same sites that we have sold
them before.

Are we being as creative as we can be when it comes to connecting people online?
