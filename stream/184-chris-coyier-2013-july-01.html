       <p>Things that would be interesting to watch/read/listen to:</p><ul><li>A barber explaining how they interpret people’s explanations of how they want their hair cut.</li><li>A dog walker explaining how they successfully find new customers and keep the ones they have.</li><li>A grandmother explaining their classic recipe for ginger snaps.</li><li>An engineer demonstrating how a rear differential works​.</li><li>An accountant pointing out the most common mistakes people make in doing home accounting.</li><li>A toy designer explaining the lengths they go to to make toys for very young children safe.</li><li>A drag queen giving a speech about the most common misconceptions about drag queens.</li><li>​An astronaut telling a story about the most unusual experience they had in space.</li><li>​A game programmer explaining enemy AI and pathfinding algorithms.</li><li>A ceramic artist demonstrating how they work with clay and create their artwork.</li><li>An icon designer showing a stack of iterations on a particular icon design and then talking about why they stopped where they stopped.</li><li>A greasy spoon waiter explaining their techniques for managing the slew of mini-chores that is the essence of being an efficient server.</li><li>A database administrator explaining the struggles of scaling at enormous scale.</li><li>A hockey player detailing what types of training gets them the most gain during the offseason.</li><li>A songwriter sharing some of their ideas on what makes a good song a good song.</li></ul><p>People talking directly about what they do is nearly always fascinating to me, regardless of the job, as long as they exude some passion about it.</p><p>This was part of the inspiration for <a href="http://css-tricks.com/lodge/">The Lodge</a> on my website CSS-Tricks. Less about dry “training” and more about the fact that it can be interesting and helpful to watch someone do what they do while they talk about it. <a href="http://chriscoyier.net/2012/09/23/working-in-public/">Working in public</a>, as it were.</p>
