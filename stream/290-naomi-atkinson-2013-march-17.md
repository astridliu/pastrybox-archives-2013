In a world where the physical is replicated in a digital format so frequently, you would think that our
processes would have evolved — some time ago — to support this. 

It would seem not. 

I’d like to bring attention specifically to publishing — where a publisher has a physical magazine, for
example, which they are also offering as a digital download (whether that be hosted online, or offered within
their own app). 

Many of the publishers I have created artwork for will use the same artwork that is sent to print to create
their digital version. 

This is a huge bug-bear for designers and brands alike, as the artwork created for print is set in CMYK
colour. When this is used on-screen, which uses the RGB colour spectrum, the artwork is simply wrong.

This is not the only issue caused by using the same artwork (another is opacity fringing which only appears in
digital versions), however it is certainly the most poignant. 

We’re all very aware of what a *huge* role colour plays in representing a brand. And this is a simple case
of the publisher’s process prohibiting us from representing a brand’s colour palette correctly — whether
our own, or a client’s.

So, I challenge all print publications out there to allow us to supply two versions of artwork. Please let us
offer the high level of service we strive for, throughout all of our communications.
