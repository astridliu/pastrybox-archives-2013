This may come as a shock to many of you, but I have something of a temper. I know, I know. I like to think
that I got pretty good at steering it, in thirty years. I don’t snap at people. I don’t go picking fights,
I mean, unless you need to get off your [redacted] phone and drive; this is a [continued redaction] crosswalk,
[incredibly redacted].

I needed that anger, when I was freelancing. I was mad because I wasn’t supposed to “make it,” on paper.
It worked—it got my blood moving every morning. I had something to prove. It sharpened me up; it gave me
focus.    

Now, though, I catch myself gritting my teeth at something three, four, five times a day. Links to all manner
of terribleness are constantly popping up on some part of my screen. There’s always something to be
righteously furious about—something that makes me want to knock the awful out of someone via TCP/IP. But,
man, it is tiring, and all that fuming sure as hell doesn’t fix anything. I’ve lost all the focus I had,
because there’s just so much to be outraged about, every day. There’s just too much.

The bottom line is that I’ve [only got so much typing left in my
hands](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/mat-marquis/2013-february-27/). I figure I can burn what I have left
by idly threatening to punch various and sundry faces, or I can try to use them to do some honest-to-God good.
I don’t know what that means just yet, but I know ratcheting up my blood pressure isn’t the right first
step.
