# Adjusting the Ignition Point Timing on a 1978 Triumph Bonneville T140E

Remove the right cylinder spark plug and carefully set it aside. Note that carefulness is optional here, as
you accidentally ordered four times as many spare plugs as can possibly be applied to a motorcycle at one
time, barring the use of a hot glue gun. Consider that you do not actually have a hot glue gun. Regret having
an account on Amazon.com.

Pull the carpenter’s pencil from behind your ear and split it lengthwise along the lead. Take the half
containing the lead and reflexively shove it back behind your ear. If this step is done correctly, you will
now have splinters in the side of your head. What is wrong with you; why would you even do that. Drop
non-ear-splinter length of pencil into the cylinder head.

Finding the cylinder’s lowest point can be accomplished by manipulating the kickstart lever by hand, making
a series of marks on the length of broken carpenter’s pencil at the top of the spark plug port. Note that it
will take significant effort to manipulate the kickstart lever by hand, and that there is probably a better
way of doing this. If desired, take a moment to reflect on how much stronger you were when you worked with
your hands. Wonder whether the memory of your father’s toughness has become exaggerated in the years since
his death. Recall the time you witnessed a 4x4 that was propping up a roof—curved like a bow—spring loose
from a floor jack and hit him across the face; recall that the entirety of his reaction was to curse quietly
to himself. Curse quietly to yourself. During this time, you may find that you have dislocated your
shoulder—this is normal. Curse loudly at yourself.

Once you’ve found the cylinder’s lowest point in the above manner, place a mark 3/8" up from the mark at
the lowest point. Manipulate the kickstart lever by han—… You will find a vial of ibuprofen in one of the
inside pockets of your electrical toolbag. Manipulate the kickstart lever by hand until this new mark aligns
with the top of the spark plug port. Your engine is now at “top dead center.” You think. You aren’t
entirely sure what that is. In any case: you are done with this part. Replace the spark plug.

Adjust the position of the ignition point adjustment plate until the right-hand cam follower—a white plastic
tab—aligns with the notched mark on the end of the camshaft. Secure the point adjustment plate with the top
and bottom pillar bolts. 

Congratulations: it is not entirely unlikely that you have properly set your ignition point timing.

If you should now have difficulty in starting, uneven idling, or misfiring: consider that a reasonable person
would not have purchased a bike that is made up of parts older than said person’s own parts, and that it is
entirely your own dumbass fault. Repeat the above steps as needed.
