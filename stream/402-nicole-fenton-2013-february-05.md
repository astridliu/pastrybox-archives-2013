This year’s for the stuff that makes me nervous.

Hard stuff. Like standing up for myself in bad situations. Getting specific and elaborating when I’m
comfortable with the opposite. Or starting conversations that need to happen.

The times when I need to apologize immediately or not be such an ass. The times when I have to [retrain my
brain](https://readmill.com/nicoleslaw/reads/help-thanks-wow-the-three-essential-prayers/highlights/zapn7g) to
think positively and make something great.

Messy stuff. Like selling ideas or teaching people [how to give
feedback](https://readmill.com/nicoleslaw/reads/design-is-a-job/highlights/n8lhtg), instead of giving up when
we don’t speak the same language.

This year’s for taking steps toward understanding.
