Three pieces of advice that have stuck with me for many years.

> “Do good work and
> everything else will follow.” [Tom Hughes](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/tom-hughes/0/40b/490) c. 2001
> 

When I was barely out of my teens, I luckily got to know Tom. He’s someone who has done everything...
co-founded Idealab, ex-Apple, ex-Lotus, ex-Polaroid etc. etc. He can talk about doing projects with Andy
Warhol! The advice he gave us that stuck was that doing good work was the spine on which everything else could
be built. A little trite-sounding maybe, but it’s worked out ok so far.

> “Politely
> decline once, then take an offered gift.” Raymond Burka c. 1997

My grandfather (who we called Opa) was kind and generous. Once, during a visit in my high school years, he
offered ten dollars each to my brother and I as we headed out the door to the movie theater.

Opa: “Here boys, let me pay for the movie.”

My brother: “No, no, we don’t need it, thank-you so much.”

Opa: “No, really, let me pay for the movie.”

My brother: “It’s ok Opa, we really don’t need it.”

Opa: “Politely decline once, then take an offered gift.”

> “Design something like
> you mean it.” [heavily paraphrased] [David Carson](http://davidcarsondesign.com/) at FITC conference Toronto
> in 2005.

I’ve been to a zillion conference presentations over the past eight years and twenty seconds of David’s
talk has still stuck with me. He showed a photograph of two garage doors in an alley. One had a professionally
designed No Parking sign bolted to it — big P in a circle with a slash through it and a perfectly typeset
warning that ‘violators will be prosecuted.’ The neighboring garage had NO PARKING hastily scrawled across
it in blood-colored spray paint. In a pinch, I’d definitely avoid the axe-murdering psycho door.
