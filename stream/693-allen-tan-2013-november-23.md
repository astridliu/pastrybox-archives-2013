I can’t listen to music when I’m designing. It’s true! Lorde, Tom Waits, The Beatles, electronica,
classical, even *movie soundtracks* — none of them work for me.

*I just can’t think.*

In our industry, it’s a fixture of people working — designing, programming, drawing, reading — that
they’re plugged in, jamming’. But I relish my quiet. I don’t want to drown it, throttle it, or bludgeon
it with music.

(I have, on occasion, stuck headphones over my ears without anything playing. If you work in a noisy
environment, it’s a different calculus.)

But if you’re like me, but haven’t wanted to admit it to those around you? Take heart, fellow whisperer.
I’m with you. We will work in silence.
