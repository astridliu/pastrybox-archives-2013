       <p>I’ve been lucky enough to get a lot of feedback recently: book reviews, conference talk evaluations, post-workshop surveys. Reams of paper and multi-column spreadsheets and emails and blog posts all dedicated to evaluating little ol’ me.</p><p>I don’t always <em>feel</em> lucky, though. More often than not, reading a review of my own work (or, worse, dozens of them all at once) feels excruciating, overwhelming, and exhausting—even if it’s positive. It always seems to find the spots where I have the least armor and jab itself right in.</p><p>But I <em>am</em> lucky. I’m lucky people bothered to take the time to tell me how I did. I’m lucky people cared enough about what I said to tell me the ways in which I can do better next time.</p><p>Most of the notes I’ve gotten have been positive, but of course I have plenty of things to work on: Slow down. Get more specific. Make more obvious ties between the little things and the larger narrative. Calm down. Slow down.</p><p>No, really, <em>slow down</em>.</p><p>I’m working on those things, of course. (I think I’m speaking about 25 percent slower than I used to—which is only 25 percent faster than I ought to be.) But even more than that, I’m working on how I relate to the feedback itself.</p><p>For a long time, these waves of feedback would bowl me over. I’d get knocked into a state of panic, obsessing over all the things I could have done better. I’d end up tumbling, reeling, scrambling to regain my footing. This <em>felt</em> crummy, sure. But the real problem was that it also left me unable to <em>do</em> anything with the information—because getting back up off the ground had already sapped all my energy.</p><p>It’s hard to take change to heart while you’re coughing up saltwater.</p><p>These days I’m trying to let the wave wash over me without it kicking my legs out from under me. Either way I’ll end up getting wet—immersed in the criticism, soaked in my own imperfection. But if I want to get better, I can’t afford to get swallowed by it anymore.</p><p>It’s not just about me, though. It’s about our entire industry, as my friend Jonathan Kahn <a href="https://twitter.com/lucidplot/status/330266621459451905">pointed out recently</a>:</p><blockquote><p>If we’re going to change culture, we need to give and receive feedback more, and we need to do it with kindness and respect. Which is HARD.</p></blockquote><p>If you agree that culture change is critical to the web—that businesses need to adapt to constant change, that organizations need to get back to being human, and that becoming flexible and iterative is the only way to keep up—then embracing and employing feedback isn’t just a means to being better liked. It’s actually the foundation of a better web.</p>
