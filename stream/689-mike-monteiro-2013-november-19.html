       <h1>What My Mom Taught Me About Client Services</h1><p>I was very lucky growing up: my mom was a seamstress. Admittedly, this meant being marched off to school in a series of plum-colored home-sewn leisure suits throughout the late 70s. But for all the shame and inorganic fabric I endured, I also got to watch my mom work. The way a seamstress approaches her work isn’t too far off from a designer. They decide to take on a client. They discuss your goals, which in her case were usually wedding dresses, her specialty. They discuss the wedding venue, the number of guests, how classy an affair it was going to be. And after a glass of wine they discussed whether the dress would be white and everyone would giggle. Then mom would bring out a photo album of dresses she’d made for other brides, everyone would go through it oohing and ahhing. More wine would be poured. At some point the bridal magazines would come out and pages would get ripped out and taped to a wall. </p><p>Throughout the course of the dress getting made, the bride would come back to the house various times for fittings. Alterations would be made. Hems were adjusted based on smiles and frowns. Sometimes based on how much wine was poured. All the while it felt like they were doing this together. I mean, my mom literally couldn’t finish the dress without the client’s involvement since it had to fit on the client’s body. So both the seamstress and the client had important roles to play. And my mother had absolutely no way of evaluating her work without the client’s participation. </p><p>And my mom didn’t judge the work on how well it looked, or how much she got paid, or even how happy the client was. She judged it on whether she’d eventually be invited to the wedding. Which she usually was. With my brothers and me in tow. And I can tell you, when the bride went up the aisle, and the crowd lit up, there was nobody in the church more proud than my mom. That was her metric of success.</p><p>I was lucky enough to watch all of this happen from the time I was old enough to remember. I was getting a master lesson in client services in my own house! From my own mother. A lesson on how to treat clients, how to build relationships with clients, and how to work <em>with</em> a client, instead of <em>for</em> a client.</p>
