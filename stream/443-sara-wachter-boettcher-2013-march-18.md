You’ve probably heard about the importance of empathy in design and communication work—of understanding
others’ emotions and considering their feelings when we make things for them to use. Corey Vilhauer has
called it “[content strategy’s hidden
deliverable](http://www.slideshare.net/blendinteractive/empathy-content-strategys-hidden-deliverable-cs-forum-2012).”
Kate Kiefer Lee says it’s [central to MailChimp’s
content](http://uxmag.com/articles/tone-and-voice-showing-your-users-that-you-care). Whitney Hess believes
it’s the foundation of an “[environment that encourages collaboration, iteration, and
risk](http://whitneyhess.com/blog/2012/04/21/user-experience-is-not-enough/).”

But empathy isn’t easy. As much as I want to have it, as much as I believe in it, I fall down on the job a
lot. I dole out advice better than I listen. I get frustrated with people who just can’t figure things out.
I’m quick to be an editor when I ought to simply be a friend. 

I think I might have found the real problem, though. We can’t begin being empathetic when another person
arrives. We have to already have made a space in our lives where empathy can thrive. And that means being
open—truly open—to feeling emotions we may not want to feel. It means allowing another’s experiences to
gut us. It means ceding control.

Empathy begins with vulnerability. And being vulnerable, especially in our work, is fucking terrifying.

## Fronting

I’ve spent most of my life putting up one front or another: against middle-school taunts, against familial
drama, against injustices both petty and profound. I suppose we all have. How else would we get through
adolescence, through job rejections, through breakups and bad news and disappointments of all sorts?

Fronting isn’t bad; it’s human. It’s a shield—a way to cope, to keep others at a safe distance, to
tell them the story we want them to see. But it’s also what’s keeping us from greatness, as Karen McGrane
wrote last month in [a column for A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/column/give-a-crap-dont-give-a-fuck):

Greatness, in other words, demands rawness. 

I’ve probably read that piece a dozen times by now (and only two of those were in my official capacity as
editor). I keep returning to it because I’ve never before had so many good things happening at once, and yet
simultaneously felt so far from great. 

This might surprise you if you know what I’ve been doing recently: taking over *A List Apart*, speaking at
conferences, publishing a book. I am, as they say, doing well. Yet that book nearly did me in—and not
because of the writing, either. I was simply scared of being exposed. 

I was terrified that the things I’d been working on—mostly alone, mostly in a little agency in Arizona
that was far from perfect and that didn’t really reflect what I wanted to be doing—were going to get
called out as minuscule and silly. That I didn’t deserve to be doing this. That I’d let people down. 

I did it anyway. I felt nauseous the whole time. 

My fears were unfounded, of course. I’ve received inspiring emails from strangers. I’ve had mostly good
reviews. I hear it might even make money someday. 

I should feel relieved. I should feel *ecstatic*. But vulnerability doesn’t work that way. I still feel this
intense desire to hide, to deflect, to cover back up all those parts I exposed to the world.

I’ve distanced myself from past projects; I’ve avoided pushing for the sort of work I really want; I’ve
glossed over details to avoid admitting how little I actually know. I’ve worked hard, terribly hard, to make
my checklist add up to a good job. 

But I am not great. Not yet. 

## Professionally vulnerable

There’s a safety in creating distance—in carefully managing perceptions and avoiding the things that make
you feel unprepared and unworthy. It’s easier to get by when you have a buffer.

But that distance not only keeps you from greatness; it also numbs you. It protects you from your own
emotions, sure. But it also makes it impossible to feel anyone else’s. 

I can’t afford to be numb. I have users to help. I have problems to solve. I have got to get more
comfortable with being uncomfortable. 

Empathy starts with vulnerability. And I’m still working on it.
