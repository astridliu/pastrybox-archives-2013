This isn’t an “I used to be fat but now I’m skinny!!” story. Not yet, anyway. Instead, I thought I’d
list some things that are true now that I weigh 250 lbs instead of 300 lbs.

 *  My back doesn’t hurt when I turn around to look behind me in the car.

 *  I enjoy perusing clothing catalogs. Turns out hatred of clothes shopping isn’t part of my personality, I
just didn’t like the “oh yay, new fabric to feel uncomfortable in” outcome.

 *  I’m excited to go on trips where the plan is a bunch of physical activity. I’m planning a skiing trip
and I’d like to take a surfing lesson next chance I get. I would actively avoid those types of trip
activities before because they would be too difficult/embarrassing/exhausting for me.

 *  The daily endless thoughts of self-pity and embarrassment are slowly being replaced by other more normal
and positive thoughts.

 *  When I applied for health insurance, I had to lie and say I was 250 lbs., otherwise obesity is a
pre-existing condition (pre Obamacare) and I would have been disqualified (it happened to me last time I
tried). Now I’m not lying anymore.

 *  I can wear jeans for more than one day now. We’ll just leave it at that.

 *  I’m not afraid of any bike ride. Bring it on.

 *  I’m taking better care of my teeth. It seems un-related, but I don’t think it is. Self betterment
spreads.

 *  I’m proof to my family and friends that it can be done.

I have a long way to go. I hope this list gets a lot longer.
