I looked down and in that moment it hit me—I was the only person wearing different shoes. Every other person
sitting in the circle was wearing the exact same type of shoes. The shoes were the same brand and even the
same color. My shoes did not match the mold. I didn’t get the memo.

That’s when it hit me like a ton of bricks falling onto my toes—I was not in my tribe. These people were
not *my* people. They were nice enough, but nice enough wasn’t what I needed. I needed to find my
people.

After this shocking shoe incident, you might assume I went to search for people who wore the same types of
shoes as I did. *Those* people would be *my* people, my tribe. But I didn’t. Instead, I knew that in order
to be with my people, I needed to look down and see none of us wearing the same shoes. That my tribe would be
wearing a mix of cowgirl boots, Converse, platform heels, flipflops, sneakers, flats, boots, and work shoes
(any shoes except for those sporty toe shoes, those sort of freak me out).

When I was a kid and throughout my entire stint of being in K12, I never belonged to one clique—to one
tribe. I was the kid that didn’t quite fit in anywhere and I wasn’t really interested in rounding my
corners to make the fit easier either. I wasn’t interested in entire cliques of people. Instead, I enjoyed
spending time with specific people from a variety of cliques. This worked out pretty well until it came time
for my birthday parties.

My friends would arrive for my birthday parties and the only thing they really had in common, was me. This
meant that most of them didn’t know each other. I became the kid that had name tags at her birthday parties.
Okay, maybe I was a total organizational nerd even then, but I promise you, “hello my name is…” was
an absolutely necessary birthday party accessory for all of my guests.

My friends had fun at my parties. I had fun at them, too. And *we* experienced this fun while none of us wore
the same shoes.

If we really want to make sure that we’re in a strong, great, creative, tribe, we need to find people who
are different than us, but who complement us. And no, not *compliment* us but *complement* us. People who
might like our style of shoes and let us know, but people who go way beyond that and help to balance our
strengths and weaknesses.
