As I write this, I’m on lockdown. “Shelter-in-place.”

It’s the first day that really feels like Spring—the first day that doesn’t just feel like a reprieve
from Winter, but the honest-to-God start of Springtime. It would be a beautiful day today.

One town over, the police are chasing down one of the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing. I woke up to
sirens on Mass Ave. and they haven’t stopped yet—not that I’ve noticed, anyway, and I’ve been
listening.

There hasn’t been any news in a while. People were tweeting out information on the Police scanner, giving
away locations and plans. The scanner has gone silent. 

It’s quiet save for the bells of St. John’s church down the street, and the sirens. It’s quiet and I
don’t know what to do.
