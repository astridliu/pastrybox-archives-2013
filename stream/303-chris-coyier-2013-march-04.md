“The best tasting tea is the tea you drink when you are in a good mood.”[1](#fn1)

That’s how I remember the quote from Uncle Iroh from the fantastic cartoon epic Avatar: The Last Airbender.
He was full of little nuggets of wisdom like this. Relevant to the moment while hinting at a larger metaphor.
I particularly like this one. 

It’s a reminder that *everything* is better when you are in a good mood. Stop lights don’t seem so long.
The 40%-on-Rotten-Tomatoes comedy movie you watch is hilarious. You respond with grace to a snarky email. 

That’s because your mind is busy smiling. You ignore the bad parts for the good. You choose to stop the
cycle of anger with a dash of cheer.

You can’t force a good mood, but if you’ve got one, use it well and hang on.

[1](#r1)That’s how I remembered it, anyway. I just re-watched the entire series to find it but the closest I
could find was: “The best tea tastes delicious whether it comes in a porcelain pot or a tin cup.” which is
also awesome.
