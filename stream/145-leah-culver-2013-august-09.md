When I write about my personal experiences I start to think about the reader.

Do my thoughts resonate with you right now? Is this a thought you’ve had in the past? Have you moved on to
other thoughts or does this idea still linger?

Sometimes as I’m reading I know that I am not quite understanding the concept on the same level as the
author. I credit some of this to inexperience — I’ve never been a parent so I can’t fully empathize
with others’ parental sentiment.

Otherwise I’ll wonder if what I’m reading is simply a thought that hasn’t occurred to me yet. Or maybe
I’ve been thinking about the idea in a completely different way.

It’s amazing how reading can shift our perspective and give us a more complete view.

Does this resonate with you?
