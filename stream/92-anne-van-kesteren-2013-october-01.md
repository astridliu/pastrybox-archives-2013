End of the third flight was nigh. “We’ll see you at the airport.” Not exactly true, but close enough I
suppose. And finally some different lines from the standard spiel. I have the feeling she might have been
slightly drunk, with the other steward smiling awkwardly while she spoke to us. But who knows, maybe she was
in an unusually good mood, hard to tell sometimes.

A lot of lights again, Boston this time. Light pollution is probably way bad, but looks nice from up high.
Also no enforcement at all today with regards to wearing headphones during take off and landing. Feels like an
improvement, though maybe the three sets of staff encountered just care less. I certainly did, with what ended
up being an eight-hour delay for me with regards to getting here, I was in no good mood. I did my best not to
take it out on anyone in particular and even cracked some jokes with the Starbucks folk in Detroit, but boy I
was pretty livid in Amsterdam. There is nothing quite like an airline letting you down.

She just informed us she will say goodbye to everyone personally. “Vaarwel!”
