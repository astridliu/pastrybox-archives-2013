       <h1>Stop Feeling Guilty: Functional Procrastination</h1><p>In one of my previous pastries, I talked about how you should always ask yourself why you do the things that you do. The premise of this was that if you consistently question yourself, you develop self-awareness and hopefully an understanding of your behaviour. With this information you might be able to change or accommodate your behaviour in order to more efficiently achieve your goals. </p><p>One of the questions I posed in that pastry about myself was ‘Why do I procrastinate the things I love?’ Sometimes, I will deliberately ignore or avoid a task or project that I’m actually in love with. It’s paradoxical in nature. Once I started to pick apart the behaviours and found my way inside their pattern, a whole lot became clear.</p><p>This is what behaviour would occur:</p><ol><li>I would pick a task or project that interests me greatly with a determined end state.</li><li>Then I would fall in love with said task or project and work obsessively on it for some amount of time</li><li>At some point I would stop working on said task or project for reasons unclear to me</li><li>Then I would likely wrestle with desire to finish project but feel overcome with apathy</li><li>Procrastination occurs.</li><li>I then repeat 5 an arbitrary number of times</li></ol><p>I came to loathe this pattern once I recognized that particular things weren’t getting done. It didn’t seem like there was any reason that I did this, and it stressed me out that I didn’t understand my own behaviour. Surely there must be a reason. I never like it when my behaviour does not make rational sense, which is frustrating because I am predisposed to be irrational as frequently as the next person.</p><p>To skip ahead of a lot of self-inquiry and discussions with peers who confront this same issue, I compiled a list of possible reasons for my procrastination:</p><ul><li>A fear of failure (because even if failure is important to progress in many cases, we are conditioned to feel shame from it by our culture(s))</li><li>A fear of success (and all of the responsibility that comes with it that we might not be prepared for)</li><li>No clear path to solving the problem or completing the project or task is apparent</li><li>The project is overwhelming to think about because it has not been broken down into more digestible tasks</li><li>Boredom from tedious tasks in the way of completing the more interesting project as a whole</li><li>Boredom from being on the same task or project for too long without a break due to time pressures or obligation</li><li>Inability to decide on one of many potential solutions or paths to completing the task or project</li></ul><p>There are probably many more items I could add to this list, but I’m merely speaking from the anecdotes of my own experience as I usually do when I compose these doughnuts. Sometimes more than one of them apply to me at any given point. Another important thing I recognized is that my level of distractibility and procrastination are very correlated. It seems that this is often the case for other people too.</p><p>Over the years people have recommended a lot of different books to me on ‘overcoming procrastination’ and I found only bits and pieces of them marginally useful. Many were patronizing and offered little in the way of substance to help me do away with this behaviour. In fact, the one thing that bothered me the most was that these books assumed that this behaviour could be ‘cured’ at all. Some habits are difficult if not impossible to change, and I’d been operating this way since I was a child. The habits that start young are the most pernicious to erase when you try and get at them. It wasn’t for lack of trying, in the case of procrastination — society has made it very clear that procrastinators must be lazy, ineffectual people. I certainly didn’t (and don’t) want to be a lazy and ineffectual person. At some point I decided to stop making myself feel guilty. Plenty of successful people I admire admit to habits of procrastination, and they still achieve and accomplish great things. So what’s the catch?</p><p>Functional procrastination.</p><p>So say it out loud with me if you’re frustrated with the shame of procrastination and the impetus to combat it:</p><p>“I’m probably always going to procrastinate, so instead I’m going to make it work for me.”</p><p>So what does this look like in practice? The first step is probably obvious, and it is to identify the reason that you are procrastinating. This is the hardest step because it means being totally honest with yourself about your behaviour, and if you’re not used to that you can and will dance around the reason. It helps to have a list like the one I’ve compiled above, you’re welcome to use it as a starting point or generate your own. Some people will tell themselves that they really and truly can’t find a reason and that this has no cause. For most people I think this means they have not been honest or given enough time to figure it out; although I bet there are a few outliers who genuinely struggle with biology that gets in the way too. The most important thing? Be honest with yourself.</p><p>Sometimes identifying the reason is enough. I know for myself, in the case where I recognize that I feel overwhelmed by a project, that the next step is to break it down into smaller parts. Then I can take on the larger project piece by piece. Sometimes once you know the reason, the path becomes clear. But often we don’t know how to break down a task further, or maybe that’s not what is making us procrastinate.</p><p>So, instead, do the following: procrastinate your task with another task that you had previously been procrastinating. Repeat as needed. </p><p>If you have a deadline or a set of deadlines you are working with your cycle of procrastination will probably need to be accelerated or altered, as it might be under time pressure. Usually the stress of the deadline means that you complete the task very close to the deadline. This is dangerous as it means you may compromise on quality. I actually recommend procrastinating projects often and early. Cycle through them, never get bored, and always be looking at the task in front of you with fresh eyes.</p><p>For personal projects or anything outside of your employment where a deadline is not required, do not set a deadline. It’s tempting to set deadlines on personal projects, because haven’t we been told our entire lives that every goal needs to have one? What if instead of this, you simply say to yourself,</p><p>“I want to accomplish this task, and I know I will eventually, and I’m okay with the fact that I don’t know when that will be. I’ll finish it when I’m excited about it, and this process may not be temporally contiguous.”</p><p>Then, iterate. When you hit a block with a project, switch to another one. Don’t guilt yourself over it, don’t hesitate, don’t tell yourself that ‘this isn’t how normal people operate’. Yes, it is. Lots of us do it. I’m not going to sit here and have someone tell me that this way of operating is bad behaviour. If you’re producing and you complete things eventually, then who cares? Don’t let anyone else judge you, your process is your own, and if it works? It works. That’s all that matters.</p><p>In the case of fear of success or fear of failure, things can get very ambiguous and this process might break down for you. I don’t have any simple answers for you on how to deal with these in the framing of this strategy. You need to keep asking yourself ‘why’ and try to get at the core of how you are feeling, which in turn will probably help you figure out how to break down dealing with yourself, which in turn may deliver you with something actionable. This is a topic that warrants an entire pastry all to itself, and these are things I will likely write about in future cupcakes.</p><p>Embrace your behaviour and make it work for you. Procrastinate on.</p><p>This post brought to you by a very overdue submission after way too many days of procrastination and reflecting on said procrastination. True story.</p>
