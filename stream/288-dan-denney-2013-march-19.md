You often hear about people learning a trade from an elder, choosing it for their path and working their
entire career in that trade. Given the amount of change that web design and development has created in the
world, it amazes me that it is not yet old enough for anyone to have done that. We’re really just getting
started.

As far back as trade work goes, there has always been someone who excels at the craft teaching others. In
2011, Kevin Hale gave a fantastic keynote at [Converge SE](http://convergese.com), that led me to dive into
research into craftsmanship and guilds. The history is so wonderful and I highly recommend reading [The
Craftsman](http://www.amazon.com/Craftsman-Richard-Sennett/dp/0300151195). In the pursuit of mastery, people
have learned directly from a master in their area. Many even lived in their master’s home and helped with
other household chores in exchange for the teachings.

As communities grew, people formed guilds and established guildhalls for meetings and information sharing.
These were formed for many reasons, my favorite of which is the good-hearted sharing of knowledge. However,
there were plenty of examples where they were created in order to “influence” the flow of trade or in
secret as a response to political happenings. Either way, there were now groups of people getting together to
share that had learned from various masters (or journeymen at that point).

The very nature of the web made it so that people could instantly share their information with people all over
the world. This is is a huge reason for the amount of impact that we have made. However, we’re missing out
on something.

Blog posts, tutorials, online code challenges, magazine articles, books, etc. all inspire people to learn, but
there is so much nuance lost in getting them into the medium. Watching someone perform their tasks is so
important. 

There are a few people beginning to do this and I hope for much more of it. The Sparkbox team are running an
[apprenticeship program](http://seesparkbox.com/apprenticeships) and Chris Coyier is running [The
Lodge](http://css-tricks.com/lodge). I share them both because one is in-office training and the other is
video training. I understand that not everyone can allow people in their office (or homes for that matter) to
watch them in action. Screen recording and talking through processes is a really close example and can capture
much more of the nuance involved with creating something for the web. (It’s much more powerful when done
over the course of an entire project.)

I hope to see lots more of things like these.
