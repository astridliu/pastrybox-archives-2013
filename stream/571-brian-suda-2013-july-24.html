       <p>Some days I wonder what the future of sports will look like. Many friends hate organised, group sports, I could go either way. But I do know that sports is big business and that technology is constantly creeping in around the seams. Sports like NASCAR, F1, American Football, and Cricket all are using some technologies to track the players or aid the viewers or both. Adding some virtual paint to explain distances or label players in real-time. The term ‘second screen’ is bantered around because we are watching TV with additional devices with us. The question then becomes how do we augment sports to get more value for the viewer, 1) without reproducing data, 2) still working without a second screen, 3) reaching beyond the simple stats, 4) using the additional device to all its capabilities. I think about these ideas in the context of sports because they are data-crazy. How many times have we heard stats about the last time team A beat team B in this type of weather when so-and-so was on the field and the coach was coming off a winning streak at the home stadium. You can slice and dice data any way you want and arrive at any outcome you want to hear. With that data in your own hands anyone can become that annoying stats guy, but at the same time give you a deeper insight into the game itself. How we relate data through our digital devices is ripe for disruption and innovation.</p>
