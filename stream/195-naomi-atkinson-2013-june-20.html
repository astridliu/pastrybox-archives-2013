       <p>Today is a sad day. This morning I received a long, tearful email from a good friend telling me that her husband has been diagnosed with Leukaemia. </p><p>I instantly wrote back (understandably she wasn’t strong enough to talk), and as I was crying, pressing send — there was a knock at my door.</p><p>My mum.</p><p>Intuition, following your gut, instinct, a sixth sense, telepathic tendencies, a genetic bond — however you like to refer to it, my mum has <em>always</em> had it when it comes to me. </p><p>Her explanation for turning up was simply “I got a sudden feeling about 10 minutes ago that you needed me”. I of course was more than grateful to have a shoulder, hers especially, to cry on.</p><p>Earlier this year, I’d taken myself away for a weekend. I needed to think about some pretty difficult decisions and required space to do it. I don’t believe I even told Mum when I was returning, but as I got off the train she was there to meet me with flowers and my dinner for that evening. She simply asked “What’s wrong darling?”. </p><p>She stayed with me for the next few hours. I’ll never forget that. And she was right, I really did need her.</p><p>All I want to share are two things:</p><ul><li>Follow your gut. Always.</li><li>Never stop appreciating the people you love. Life is short.</li></ul><p class="footnote">Dedicated to my incredible and loving mum, Bernadette.</p>
