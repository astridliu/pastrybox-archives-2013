I regularly reflect on the story of the Surveyor project at NASA as described in Good Strategy Bad Strategy by
Richard Rumelt.

If nobody knew what the lunar surface was comprised of, how were they going to build a vehicle which could go
out and explore the landscape of the moon?

Scientists had whittled down their theories to four possible terrains, but were unable to come to a conclusion
on which one was the most likely outcome. Some believed it would be formed of giant boulders and rocky
terrain, whilst others theorised long pointed shards like a bed of nails. Without an answer development
stopped.

Finally, Phyllis Buwalda wrote a specification with a statement of what the Lunar surface was like — not
what she *thought* it was like. The machine would have large wheels akin to a tractor designed to handle flat
and rocky terrain. She based her design theory on something which she could relate to: The deserts of
Southwest America.

Her conclusion was that the desert was the most barren, desolate and gruelly terrain we have conquered. If the
Moon was any worse than this — we weren’t going back there anyway.

With the specification complete the wheels were designed and engineered by Ferenc Pavlics at General
Motors.

I love this brave leadership and sense of taking charge, even if it is a case of rolling the dice. Too often
we say we want to push boundaries or step into the unknown, only to be constrained by our own uncertainty. You
might end up with a result you didn’t want, but even then, sometimes that leads to unexpected wonders, think
of Viagra, Super Glue, or Penicillin.

When we’re faced with difficult choices, it can often be hard to reach a compromise. I think Buwalda showed
that by stepping away from the discussion and rethinking the approach entirely, you can define a strategy that
allows you to keep moving instead of being broken down at the crossroads.
