       <p>We all know that it is important to find a good balance between life and work. What doesn’t get shared as often is how important it is to balance work that inspires you and work that does not. My all-time favorite quote is from Howard Thurman and he says “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive, and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”</p><p>If you have been watching the activity in the design and dev community over the past couple of years, you will see countless examples of people who did this. It had never been more apparent to me than a couple of weeks ago at <a href="http://convergese.com">Converge SE</a> in Columbia, SC. Every speaker that shared their story on the main day had a common theme. They worked on something that made them come alive (in addition to their daily job or work). Doing this led to some big opportunity or career change and ultimately led them to the stage to inspire us.</p><p>On an individual level we see people doing this kind of work (and sharing it) earn new positions or the type of clients that they really enjoy. At the company level, we see teams that build their own product get picked up by bigger companies to work on products with more impact. I can’t say how much longer it will last, but be sure to strike while the iron is hot.</p><p>Our industry is spoiled right now. The demand for what we do significantly outweighs the supply of people who can do it well. The things that we build are creating new industries with new opportunities and shaking up existing ones. There is work out there that would make you happily get out of the bed in the morning or work late at night. You just have to show the world that you want it.</p>
