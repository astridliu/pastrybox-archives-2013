There's been a lot of talk about sexism in this industry of late and don’t get me wrong, I'm all for talk,
it helps us to form ideas and opinions, it helps us change things.  

It’s frustrating though that so much emphasis is being put onto this perceived male/female divide. It feels
a little reductive sometimes to focus on this male/ female sex argument. Especially given that sex and gender
aren’t really one and the same thing. Broadly speaking, we are born with a certain sex and gender is learned
– we are taught, in many ways and from many different sources, how men and women should be seen and how they
should behave. Gender is to a point merely a social construct.

Men and women have stereotypical traits, and we are all quick to reference them and it can prompt an easy
laugh or two. But just like any stereotype, it’s stupid to assume that men and women all fit neatly into a
typical gender role. We all know men who are really emotionally intelligent and women whose balls are just as
big (metaphorically speaking) as any mans in this industry. I am not suggesting that men and women aren’t
different; I’m merely saying we are ALL different.

This industry isn’t the only one to suffer sexist, outdated attitudes. I would bet there isn’t an industry
out there that doesn’t still suffer from these. Generally speaking there are more men than women in
industry, due to many social factors. It feels as though it’s perceived to be a bigger problem in the tech
industry and maybe it is… I’m no expert, but just maybe it’s because we all have a much more open
platform to share our feelings online that it seems this way. 

Sharing is no bad thing, it enables us to empathise with each other and change things for the better. So if
you are fed up with the comments and abuse that you feel is motivated by sex, or if you feel that there
aren’t enough women in the tech industry – then do something about it - get involved with
[GirlsWhoCode](http://www.girlswhocode.com/) or start a coding/design/social media club at your local school -
take positive steps and bring attention to any new and fantastic initiatives you come across. Not to the
minority of idiots who give us all a bad name - whether they be male or female. 

We all have to earn respect but don't automatically assume that men won't respect you in this industry.
Don’t believe the hype - assume that they will. We will never be able to control other people's reactions to
us, but that should not stop us working/writing/sharing/dressing how we want and being who we want to be. The
only thing each of us can control are our reactions to others, and to be respectful of our differences. 

As Ghandi said: - 'Be the change you want to see in the world' 

So do your job, do it as well as you can – you may encounter rudeness, criticism and possibly even abuse
from people, from both sexes. But just remember that this says a lot more about those people than it does
about you. Don't humour these broken people, they’ve lost their way and are desperately trying to get
attention. If you feel threatened – tell someone who can help, go to the Police. Telling social media may
feel cathartic (we’ve all been there!) but it won't protect you or help educate that person.

It's not up to anyone else to dictate what you can and can’t do and to define you by your sex. I truly
believe that in 2013 we should be way past any notion that one sex is more capable than another. Be as good as
you can be. 

Good work is good work, A good idea is a good idea – Regardless of your sex or gender.
