       <p>I’d say I’m a pretty private person. I avoid sharing <em>personal</em> things about myself with the masses. I much prefer to share everything—most likely too much—with my close friends and family either on the phone or in person, over a cup of tea. It is for that reason I struggle with a lot of social media and often find I actually end up resenting particular networks and their apps.</p><p>Being a web designer—and an advocate of online products and services—this isn’t something I usually share. In fact I’m rather surprised to find myself sharing this with you at all…</p><p>I love our industry, I love the fact that it’s built largely on the back of us sharing so much. But I continually ask myself: Is it all just a bit much? Are we simply <em>oversharing?</em></p><p>I think we are, and oversharing brings the need for <em>filtering</em>.</p><p>We filter our Facebook feeds, we unfollow on Twitter, we carefully choose whose pictures we see on Instagram, and yet, despite all this, our feeds still bloat quickly, and the generation of content only seems to accelerate.</p><hr><p>In our physical world we are creating ‘things’ at an unprecedented rate; we always seem to make space for <em>another</em> Starbucks, supermarket, or housing estate; we continue to build on every inch of free land we find; we create waste as such an alarming rate that we struggle to manage it, opting to bury it in landfill sites with no thought as to the long-term.</p><p>Is our virtual world, the internet, simply going to follow in the same footsteps? Will this article, for example, follow the fate of the used crisp packet, buried deep underground somewhere, unreachable, yet <em>still</em> somehow existing?</p><hr><p>If this is to be the case then I’d certainly be challenging myself as to what I leave as my ‘virtual legacy’. If the abundance of content we each create will always exist in some form then I would personally like to make sure that—when <em>I do</em> share—I do it to spread good.</p><p>I challenge you to think about how your virtual legacy would be read.</p>
