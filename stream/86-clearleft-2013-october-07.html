       <p>I regularly reflect on the story of the Surveyor project at NASA as described in <cite>Good Strategy Bad Strategy</cite> by Richard Rumelt.</p><p>If nobody knew what the lunar surface was comprised of, how were they going to build a vehicle which could go out and explore the landscape of the moon?</p><p>Scientists had whittled down their theories to four possible terrains, but were unable to come to a conclusion on which one was the most likely outcome. Some believed it would be formed of giant boulders and rocky terrain, whilst others theorised long pointed shards like a bed of nails. Without an answer development stopped.</p><p>Finally, Phyllis Buwalda wrote a specification with a statement of what the Lunar surface was like — not what she <em>thought</em> it was like. The machine would have large wheels akin to a tractor designed to handle flat and rocky terrain. She based her design theory on something which she could relate to: The deserts of Southwest America.</p><p>Her conclusion was that the desert was the most barren, desolate and gruelly terrain we have conquered. If the Moon was any worse than this — we weren’t going back there anyway.</p><p>With the specification complete the wheels were designed and engineered by Ferenc Pavlics at General Motors.</p><p>I love this brave leadership and sense of taking charge, even if it is a case of rolling the dice. Too often we say we want to push boundaries or step into the unknown, only to be constrained by our own uncertainty. You might end up with a result you didn’t want, but even then, sometimes that leads to unexpected wonders, think of Viagra, Super Glue, or Penicillin.</p><p>When we’re faced with difficult choices, it can often be hard to reach a compromise. I think Buwalda showed that by stepping away from the discussion and rethinking the approach entirely, you can define a strategy that allows you to keep moving instead of being broken down at the crossroads.</p><p style="text-align: right"><a href="http://byandyparker.com">—Andy Parker</a></p>
