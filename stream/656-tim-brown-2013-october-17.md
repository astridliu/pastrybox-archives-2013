Do what you said you would do.

Itâ€™s not always fun. You may need to remind yourself [why you
care](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/tim-brown/2013-february-6/) and [why your work
matters](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/tim-brown/2013-april-7/). Over time, you learn. To [know better
when to commit](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/tim-brown/2013-september-19/). To [make commitments based on
your goals](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/tim-brown/2013-may-1/). And to [manage pressure as
needed](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/tim-brown/2013-august-6/).

It pays. Doing what you said you would do builds trust, and helps you accomplish goals.
