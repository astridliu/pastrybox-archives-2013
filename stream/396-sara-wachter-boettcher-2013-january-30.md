2012 was a weird year. I wrote a book, moved 2,400 miles, started editing a magazine, and gave talks on four
continents. I even [pet a cheetah](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mirka23/8162995694/). 

But it was also the first year in memory where I didn’t read novels. 

Oh, I *read* all right. I downed blog posts and skimmed technical titles. Scoured web-professional articles
and tried to keep up with the news. But for most of the year, the closest I got to a work of fiction was
hurrying through a short story at the airport. 

Sure, I’d started Ada or Ardor—a sprawling Nabokov tome that reads like a Tolstoy family drama, if old
Leo were high on modernity, absurdity, and possibly mescaline—in January. And I was falling in love with it,
too, in all its illicit eroticism and decadent allusion. Yet I put it down a third of the way through and
never managed to pick it back up.

This isn’t like me at all. 

At first, I thought the problem was a lack of work-life balance—that I was spending too much time slaving
over projects and paydays, and not enough giving in to curiosity and culture. But the problem wasn’t
just that I was working *too much* (though I probably was). It was that I’d cut off my nose to spite my
face: In order to make more time for work, I was removing the very things that allowed me to get any *good* at
my work in the first place. 

You see, the truth about the web is that there’s no inherent *there* there. The only substance it has is
the substance we give it—which means that if we’re not *substantial people*—people who’ve read
far and wide, thought long and hard, and discovered what it is that matters—then the web work we’re
capable of will always be shallow. 

Don’t get me wrong. I love my work. I love thinking about users, helping organizations get more
realistic about publishing, and making content memorable. I love my clients. I love writing about and working
on the web. Most of all, I love the array of super-smart people I’ve had the chance to meet, work with,
and learn from along the way. But if we don’t explore the rest of the world—if we don’t get
outside our work and wander into whatever weird corners we fancy—we’ll never be able to give our work
*life*. We’ll have a slew of “best practices,” but nothing worth practicing. 

It’s not just about reading novels, of course. It’s about living fully—about experiencing the
world in all its complexity and exposing yourself to ideas that are foreign and challenging. It’s about
getting constant practice at thinking critically and connecting disparate concepts. It’s about building
interesting things because you’re an interesting person. 

So this year, I’m not giving all my attention to the endless novelty of web work. I’m making space
for a Nabokov novel.
