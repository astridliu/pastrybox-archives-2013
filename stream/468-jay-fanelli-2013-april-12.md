Here’s a semi-exhaustive list of the things we’ve tried as a company over the past four years that failed
(or never got off the ground):

 *  An iPad app that aids in drawing and illustrating

 *  An online community where professionals teach clients the basics of the web design and development
process

 *  A better kind of fantasy football

 *  A better sports score app

 *  No fewer than three separate iOS game concepts

 *  A restaurant partnership

Here’s a semi-exhaustive list of the things we’ve tried as a company over the past four years where the
jury’s still out on whether they’ll ever succeed:

 *  A podcast

 *  A job board

 *  A spinoff t-shirt brand

Taken together, that’s a lot of failure. I’d go so far as to say that we’ve gotten used to failing.

By most measures, [my company](http://fullstopinteractive.com/) is successful. We design and build
nice websites, we have a [side business selling t-shirts](http://www.unitedpixelworkers.com/), and we
earn enough money to comfortably support three people full-time. But we’ve clearly screwed up. A lot. The
lists above represent an overwhelming majority of our non-client services efforts over the past four years.
And the precious few efforts that have succeeded have only done so after significant time and
modifications.

The thing is, failure gets a bad rap. If you’re an individual or a small group like us—and most of the web
design industry is—failure is rarely catastrophic. You try something in your spare time, it doesn’t work,
you move on. It’s not an all-or-nothing, “bet the farm” proposition. Our industry is so successful
because it’s comprised of people who aren’t afraid to take chances. We encourage and reward
experimentation, and with experimentation comes failure. Almost everyone we consider successful is only afloat
because they’re standing atop a raft built from their own failures. Here’s someone we’ve always
considered a model for our business, Jim Coudal, talking about failure in a [Design Glut
interview](http://www.designglut.com/2009/08/jim-coudal-of-coudal-partners/):

> We’ve
> had a lot of things not work, and that’s OK too. If it’s a good idea and it gets you excited, try it, and
> if it bursts into flames, that’s going to be exciting too. People always ask, “What is your greatest
> failure?” I always have the same answer – We’re working on it right now, it’s gonna be
> awesome!

We launched a [new internal project](http://cottonbureau.com/) not too long ago. It’s big, it’s
ambitious, and it’s taken months of planning and sketching and designing and building to get to this point.
Who knows if it’ll work. If it does, it has the potential to fundamentally change what we are as a business.
If it doesn’t, we’ll shed a tear and throw it on the junk pile. And then we’ll try again later with
something else.
