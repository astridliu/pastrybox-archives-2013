       <p>I introduce a new process into my work routine, and my next project goes much more smoothly. I restructure a client’s website and their conversions soar. I adopt a new management style and my company has a particularly excellent year.</p><p>I’m doing a good job, right?</p><p>Maybe. But without more data, collected over a longer period of time, I can’t really tell. I might be doing a great job, and my actions might be the main reason for your success. Or I might be doing a mediocre job and succeeding merely because of other factors like great colleagues or external market forces. I might even be doing a terrible job, and succeeding out of sheer good luck—for awhile, at least. </p><p>When we behave in a particular way, and afterward receive professional rewards, it’s very tempting to believe that our actions are causative—that they produced those rewards, and that we should therefore a.) benefit personally from our effective actions, and b.) carry on as we have been, confident in our wisdom. </p><p>When things go wrong, on the other hand, it’s very easy to assume a lack of causation: A project failed not because of my bad communication, but because the client was just too incompetent. My team fell apart because of random events in the individual members’ lives—certainly not because I practiced poor leadership. My company had a terrible year because the market was weird and unpredictable.</p><p>Of course, we still have to make decisions or face paralysis. When things go well, it’s often a sign that we’re acting effectively; when they go poorly, it’s often not our fault. But if we always interpret the positive outcomes as a sign that we’re right, and rarely interpret the negatives as a sign that we’re wrong, we make a useless hash of our data and bar the door to useful self-doubt. (Doing it the other way around is also a problem—too much self-doubt can drown us.)</p><p>In the last few years, I’ve watched closely as many talented people in our field become increasingly effective leaders—and as a few get trapped in echo chambers that reinforce their every choice, no matter its effect on their clients, coworkers, and end-users. So I think about these questions a lot: How can we grow without getting stuck? How can we lead teams without losing empathy? How can we maintain the confidence to act without losing our capacity for self doubt? How can we mature professionally in ways that keep our eyes open and our critical faculties fully engaged?</p><p>I don’t have answers, but I have a small suspicion that the first step is to keep asking these questions.</p>
