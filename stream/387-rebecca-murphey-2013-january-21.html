    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>At <a href="http://bocoup.com">Bocoup</a>, we recently conducted an internal survey about working remotely and methods for communicating with people who aren&#8217;t working from the Boston office. We used a Google Docs form to gather responses, and when all of the answers were in, I had a spreadsheet with about 300 data points.</p><p>It probably surprises no one here that I exported the data as a CSV and then wrote a small program to tell me what everyone had said. I used Ruby because there are still times when the asynchronicity of JavaScript makes a solution perfectly absurd, but certainly I could have written it in JS, or Python, or Perl, or probably even Java if I was a special kind of masochist. There wasn&#8217;t much to it: key concepts included iteration over lists of things, turning strings into lists of things, and using hashes to accumulate the totals. If I didn&#8217;t know about hashes I still could have made it work, though it would have been a wee bit less flexible. It was about 40 lines of terrible but working code.</p><p>Where my partner works, there are grown-ups who make a very good living who can barely use Excel, even though they work with data every day. Their processes are as inefficient as you might expect as a result. These colleagues of hers aren&#8217;t fresh out of college, but they&#8217;re young enough that they have decades ahead of them where they will need to make money. I know my partner could readily learn how to write little programs like the one I wrote, but she is reluctant to invest the time because she knows that no one else at her job could understand them, and she&#8217;s already an order of magnitude better at the technology side of things than most of her colleagues.</p><p>I wonder often what will happen in fields like this. It is sobering to remember how far behind they are: still crunching data by hand, still versioning documents using filenames, still emailing documents around and around and around because it&#8217;s the most reliable solution that everyone involved can understand. On the one hand, it makes me feel like my comfort with technology means I will probably always be employable; on the other hand, I have to remind myself that I could probably never bear to work there.</p>
