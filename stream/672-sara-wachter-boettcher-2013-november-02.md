I’m all feelings these days. Mushy-smushy, ooey-gooey feelings. I go to a conference and end up at a dinner
table with my content strategy colleagues, telling them about the time a particularly dramatic truth-or-dare
misstep got me ostracized for the entirety of sixth grade, and how I felt ashamed of the whole thing, still,
almost two decades later.

I finish up a staff planning workshop for *A List Apart* with bear hugs and text messages full of <3s,
sappy as all get-out about working with great people.

I try to write about my content strategy work—the often very practical stuff I do to help organizations make
their content make sense—and I end up with posts about being
[vulnerable](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-march-2013/), about
[fear](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-july-11/), about [having a good cry at a
conference](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/sara-wachter-boettcher/2013-september-28/).

When’d my work life get so *emotional*?

I didn’t intend for that to happen. I thought I’d keep on writing about content modeling and editorial
strategy and mobile. I thought I’d take on substantial posts about rolling up my sleeves and *figuring
things out*. But the more I did that work, the more I wanted to write about the other stuff, too— the
barriers I ran into trying to get work implemented, the people problems and political reasons that content is
so *hard*.

And that’s when it started getting squishy. Because the more I explored those things, the more I realized
that I couldn’t keep talking about organizations’ messiness unless I was also willing to talk about
*humans’* messiness.

And this particular human? She’s pretty messy. I forget to listen sometimes. I’m antsy. I’m
inconsistent. I’m helpful and supportive—as long as you’re doing the thing I think you ought to. I’m
ambitious—so ambitious I sometimes seek out things I don’t even really *want*.

I’d love not to admit all that, but I have to now. It’s part of the deal I made with myself this year: if
I want people to be honest with me, if I want my client relationships to be based on shared values and actual
connection, then I have to bring my whole self—in all my not-quite-right glory—to the table.

Being real—desperately, painfully, awkwardly real—used to terrify me, but it gets easier the more I do it.
People I love and respect the most have even told me that opening up and talking about their struggles with
depression and fears of inadequacy and general not-always-having-their-shit-together has led them to their
most satisfying work to date.

That doesn’t mean it’s easy, or that everyone will understand—as my friend Shannon Fisher [spoke about
at the Dare Conference](http://www.republicofquality.com/courage-in-vulnerability):

So will I, I think. So will you.
