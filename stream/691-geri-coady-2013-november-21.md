Last night I was speaking to a good friend of mine about the state of design trends in the industry. Like me,
he’s an illustrator, but with a little less experience in the web world. He’s now working in a studio that
specializes in app design, and his stories are all too familiar.

“A guy told me I couldn’t use a button in an interface because it wasn’t very iOS 7.” 

Um… okay, then.

I should say that I’ve liked Apple and have exclusively used Mac OS and iOS since switching from Windows
back in 2004. But as devoted as I may be, being a fan of the brand is not an excuse to hop on a bandwagon.

I find it pretty alarming when a single company’s design decisions can make other designers develop a fear
of falling behind or looking dated. It’s even *more* alarming when these design decisions are taken as
gospel with no deeper thought. 

Should we *really* be dropping buttons, even if it negatively affects intuitive interaction patterns or
confuses people with cognitive disabilities? Should we *really* be using thin type to look “modern” at the
risk of decreasing legibility? And tell me, should we *really* be dropping textures and reducing contrast
because it’s the “stylish” thing to do this week?

“I’ve never heard anyone say, ‘Oh, this illustration has texture, I think it would look better flat and
a little more 2013, don’t you think?'”

My friend made an interesting analogy between illustrators and app designers―most successful illustrators
have their own signature style that’s attractive because of its uniqueness, but everybody wants apps to look
the same. Most illustration styles seem to stand up to the test of time, but last year’s app now looks like
this year’s Uggs-with-leggings fashion faux-pas.

Design is homogenizing, and I’m not happy with how one company can have such a strong effect over the entire
industry. We’re supposed to be figuring out the most *appropriate* solution for each design problem—not
simply apply a trendy veneer.

Can we all just try to be a little more appropriate? Who knows, we might even look a little more unique in the
end.
