At the beginning of this year I hung a poster. A poster created four years ago that I finally got around to
buying.

I hung it in my bedroom; it’s the first thing I see when I wake, and the last thing I see before I
sleep.

Things this year have been especially challenging. I’ve hit many hurdles, as we all do—professional,
emotional, and financial. Let’s just say it hasn’t been easy, so I’ve been very aware of the things and
the people around me that have lightened my load and given me comfort.

This poster has most certainly been one of those. 

I honestly believe that it’s helped motivate me. It’s picked me up, reminded me to stay passionate (or
otherwise question what I’m doing), and above all it’s given me comfort and confidence in who I
am.

I’d strongly recommend that you [hang one of your
