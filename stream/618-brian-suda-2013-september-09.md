I love the ‘Everybody votes’ channel on the Nintendo Wii. If you haven’t seen it, go look it up. It is
probably one of the best examples of an incredibly simple prediction market all beautifully wrapped-up as a
throw-away kids game. Experts toil over game mechanics, exit polls, statistical methods and yet a simple
question, asked twice; once from your point of view and again from your neighbour’s makes for an incredibly
simple yet robust result. We have a lot to learn from this to improve our data gathering and reporting. Every
time I see it, it makes me smile.
