    <div class="thought-content">
       <p>2013 is nearly over, and with the new year and thoughts of resolutions fast approaching, self-reflection is inevitable.</p><p>One of the most important things I realized this year (that I probably should have realized much earlier) is that I’m not nearly as shy as I used to be. </p><p>Growing up, I avoided public speaking whenever possible. I hated speaking in front of the class—I think I only ever gave two speeches in all the years I spent in school. So, naturally, when I was asked to speak for the first time at a local web conference not only in front of an audience of attendees, but also other speakers who were hugely inspiring and important to me, I was pretty nervous.</p><p>As it turned out, I only assumed I’d be nervous. Once I got up there and started speaking, I felt completely relaxed and confident. I had no idea what had happened.</p><p>Looking back, I credit a few things to feeling comfortable on stage. Being prepared, knowing your material, and rehearsing are all important, but my seemingly newfound confidence likely stemmed from my willingness to try more and more new things over the past couple of years.</p><p>Attending more conferences and meeting new people. Getting my first full book illustration job for a major publisher. Doing motorcycle training and learning how to ride a Vespa. Travelling on my own more often. All of those things helped, even if I didn’t realize they would at the time.</p><p>Of course, not everything I’ve tried has been a success. Last year I gave in and decided to hire a Japanese teacher for private lessons, hoping it would finally keep me on the path to learn the language I’ve wanted to learn for years. I know a lot of vocabulary and know two of the three alphabets. I have a pretty good grasp of pronunciation and I can sing dozens of Japanese songs by heart. Yet, for some reason, the idea of practicing and learning under a native speaker was scary for me. I felt far more nervous ringing the doorbell, knowing I’d have to communicate the next five minutes entirely in Japanese, than I did before getting on stage in front of three hundred people to give a talk. Looking back, I can probably thank those lessons for reducing the stress and anxiety most people do associate with public speaking, even if I did quit after just a few weeks.</p><p>I’m not saying I don’t get nervous at all—but sharing stories with other speakers has led me to believe that I might not be as bad as I expected to be. I don’t throw up. I don’t get stomach aches. I can eat a pretty decent breakfast the morning before my talk. I was more afraid of the idea of giving a talk than actually getting up there and delivering it. </p><p>I’m still a quiet person, especially if I’m in a group of new people I don’t know well, and I definitely need my time to recharge after any intense socializing—I’m a textbook introvert. But with each passing year I feel my confidence growing, and I definitely can’t wait to see what 2014 has to bring!</p>
