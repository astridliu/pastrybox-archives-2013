When I was younger, I played trumpet in a jazz band. I bring it up, because what makes great jazz is when the
musician breaks the rules. When they do the unexpected. When you listen to a trained musician who knows all
the rules and knows how to break them, you want to listen to their music over and over again. The same is true
in design. Taking risks in design is what makes design interesting, but designers are usually making something
for someone else. We need to develop a relationship strong enough that you will trust us when we say the
payoff will be worth the risk.
