In my previous article I wrote about “[Getting a dream
job](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/oli-studholme/2013-november-29)”, but there’s an aspect I didn’t
mention, without which your job (and the work you produce) will probably never surpass merely so-so. Working
professionally on the web is almost always a team sport now, there’s just too much for any one person to
know. Even if you are a one-person shop, you are still collaborating with a client.

That secret ingredient is trust.

You need to trust your colleagues to deliver what they promise, or to have your back during crunch. You need
to trust your bosses to keep you in the loop, and to stand by you even when things go pear-shaped. If you
don’t have that feeling in your current job, start looking for somewhere better. If you are the boss, it can
be difficult to give tasks to your team and trust they’ll deliver, especially when it’s something you can
do. However by trusting them and leaving them to it, they’ll often exceed your expectations.

I feel incredibly lucky to work with people I trust implicitly at [iA](http://ia.net), and I think our trust
in each other is a big part of why together we do great work.

Work with great people, people you can trust.
