How many people need to use your product for it to be worthwhile? How much of each of those people’s lives
needs to be spent using your product for it to be successful? How much of their attention during that time
does your product need to be useful? 

Instead of measuring successful products by number of users, time spent or engagement, could we consider
products successful according to how efficiently they utilize the resource of other people’s time and
attention?
