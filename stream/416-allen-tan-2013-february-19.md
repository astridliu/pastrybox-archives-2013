Sometimes you have to step away from your work to see what’s not there.

[This video](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2013/feb/06/naples-parking-fiasco-holdup-video) is
most-probably-definitely-maybe staged, but I don’t love it any less for that. It takes an everyday situation
and flips it into absurdity. It’s hilarious and a little painful to watch, as it builds and builds up
to…well, keep watching to the end.

There’s so much there you can laugh at. You don’t need to have lived in Italy, you don’t need to drive
or park — I showed this to a 7-year-old and she laughed as hard as I did. I wish more of our work could be
like this. To have low barriers. To be liked by people of all kinds. To have a bit more range.
