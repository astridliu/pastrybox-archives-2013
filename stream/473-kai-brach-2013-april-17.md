Failure is the new success. Hardly a day goes by without me stumbling across a blog post or quote that
embraces a “failures are important” attitude. Sometimes I hear people talk about their professional
failures as if they are talking about a list of achievements. Of course, being constructive and supportive are
values I highly appreciate about the web community. However, there are a few things that I can’t stop
thinking about whenever I read yet another “fail often” post.

Back in the day — before easy venture capital and 4-hour work days — real failure often had a much more
disastrous meaning. For instance, my uncle tells me about how he “wasted” eight years of his life trying
to make a self-funded business idea work that eventually left his family relying on social welfare payments.
During that time, more often than he wants to admit he went to bed hungry or had to deny his kids even the
most basic wish. I’d love to know what he would say about us putting up posters that proclaim “Fail often.
Fail early.”

When your app doesn’t make Apple’s Editor’s Choice; when your side project never sees the light of day
because you are too busy working at a well-paying job; when your startup blows through five million dollars of
venture capital within a mere three months, have you really failed or did you just get carried away enviously
measuring yourself with rich entrepreneurs featured on Techcrunch?

Instead of talking about how to deal with failure, why aren’t we talking more about how to recognise
success? How can we measure success in an industry with billion-dollar exits and overnight celebrity
status?

I’m often congratulated on the success I’m having with [Offscreen Magazine](http://www.offscreenmag.com).
The surprising thing about this is that it took me a pretty long time to agree and realise that I am, in fact,
successful. 

It wasn’t a feature article in the New York Times (although that would be nice), it wasn’t venture capital
firms that came knocking (why would they?) and it most certainly wasn’t enormous profits flooding my bank
account (welcome to publishing!). 

It’s the acknowledgment that success is not a final destination, but the journey itself. Are you doing
something you truly enjoy? Do you have friends and colleagues telling you that you’re doing great work? Are
you being compensated in a fair way that allows for a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle? Yes? Congratulations,
you’re being successful! Now, who said failure?
