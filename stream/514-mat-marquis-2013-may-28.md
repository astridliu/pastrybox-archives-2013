I left this comment on a G+ post about getting more web developers involved in web standards, last month.

I should say up-front that I do stand by it: working in web standards is incredibly frustrating. It involves
no small amount of interaction with people who seem to have graduated from the Hacker News Commenter School of
Diplomacy. We “authors” don’t hold much weight in standards discussions; at least, nowhere near as much
as browser representatives do.

Now, do I think more full-time designers and web developers should get involved in standards, after all this
glowing endorsement? Absolutely. The fact is, we don’t have the kind of voice we ought to have because
we’re *not there*. “Author preference” is very often used to argue for or against something in a
standards discussion, but very few of us are around to agree or disagree. We’re a talking point more than
we’re active participants.

Join a mailing list, start a community group; make yourself heard. When you see someone post “I think
developers will prefer X,” speak up. When you’re building something and find yourself cursing out some
strange syntax or thinking to yourself “this would have made so much more sense if,” don’t chalk it up
to someone in web standards dropping the ball. Don’t assume someone with a louder voice than yours is going
to keep it from happening again.
