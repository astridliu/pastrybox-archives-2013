       <h1>Getting a dream job</h1><p>Questions about “necessary qualifications” in our field are evergreen, and there’s been <a href="http://ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community">recent</a> <a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/">discussion</a> about the “GitHub is your resumé” idea. However, I’d like to ignore that and approach getting a job from the other end: what are employers looking for? Let’s generalize! </p><h2>Think like your future boss</h2><p>What is your future boss looking for in an employee? We can break this down into three broad categories: </p><p><strong>Hard skills</strong> are the ones we generally focus on — whether you can write clean code, or design a sweet interface. An expert can generally gauge this by looking at your previous work, and discussing the thinking that went into it with you (this second part is key). Even at first glance average work can be worthwhile <em>if you can explain the thinking (and requirements) behind it</em>, so be able to show your working. Qualifications are generally not so important, so don’t worry if you lack them (most of us do). </p><p><strong>Soft skills</strong> include things most of us haven’t thought about since high school career advice class, but these are also essential, and harder for a potential employer to assess. These include things like:</p><ul><li><em>Communication skills:</em> The ability to listen, communicate clearly what you’re doing and why, and speak &amp; write (at least) passably ← not doing so can look sloppy, so work on this if you know you need to.</li><li><em>Dedication:</em> A love for your profession, the desire to do things the right way rather than the easy way (and not be motivated solely by money or ego), and to be always learning.</li><li><em>Maturity:</em> It seems strange to mention this, but being organized, being able to work autonomously, doing what you say you will (dependability), and loyalty are surprisingly not as universal as you’d think. This also includes things like not changing frameworks to the latest hotness mid-project, just because.</li><li><em>Not being “that guy”:</em> It takes all sorts, but good personal hygiene and social awareness definitely help. Not that this applies to you, dear reader, but not being an asshole is also important. Bottom line: you have to be someone other employees can cope interacting with for 8+ hours a day.</li></ul><p><strong>“Fit”</strong> is the third category, and perhaps the one you can do the least about. You have to be a good fit for the team, both in terms of your skill set and your ability to work with them. It helps if you share some of the team’s common values, and of course if you’re a team player. As a wise person once told me, “The right person in the wrong team, company or job is the wrong person.” A good manager should also want to make sure the job, company, and career path fit <em>you</em>. If you’re not doing something that challenges you, makes you happy, and lets you grow, it won’t be good for either party. </p><h2>How to get your dream job</h2><p>This is where things get tricky. Generally we focus on improving our hard skills, and a great way to show this is by documenting your progress on a weblog. It also lets you practice communicating ideas clearly. Try to keep tabs on (and experiment with) what’s new in your field. You can keep up with the play by following people’s blogs or on Twitter, and by going to events and meetups. </p><p>Find people (and companies) you’d like to work with then follow their stuff, give useful feedback (for example, pointing out a typo is always appreciated), and ask questions. By doing so you’ll get to know like-minded people naturally, without needing to stray into the shady realms of “networking”. A lot of finding a great job is luck, and forming these connections can be a great way to find out about work. </p><p>If you really want to work at a specific company and think you have what it takes, meet someone who works there (or send them a short, memorable note), and say so. They may not have something suitable for you right then, so make a point to touch base occasionally to see how they’re going and if there’s anything you can help with. If you’re already a fan it helps the employer because you’ll share values, and be more likely to be a good fit. It can lead to an internship or a short-term project, which can easily lead to bigger things. When approaching people be respectful of their time, and don’t feel offended if nothing happens initially. It takes time to form a relationship — play the long game. </p><p>Try to <em>think like an employer</em> — what can you bring to the table? Don’t feel overwhelmed by how little you know when you’re just starting out, as employers are also looking for “potential”, and getting an internship with a good company is a great opportunity. Also, make sure you’re genuine. Lying about your skills or spamming people almost always backfires — even a hint of insincerity is a red flag. </p><p>Finally and most importantly, always be learning and challenging yourself. Work to become the person an employer wants to hire, someone with both hard and soft skills.</p>
