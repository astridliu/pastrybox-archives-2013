Every time I come across inflated statements like this (and that’s *a lot* of times), I think back to a
great article fittingly titled “[Apocalyptic hyperbole leaves journalism
speechless](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-21/apocalyptic-hyperbole-leaves-journalism-speechless/2648838)”.


Please add it to your reading list, you won’t regret it.

In today’s numbskull media environment only the loudest and most bombastic language can trigger the
slightest of reactions. We’ve become completely desensitised by our own words. Somewhere in between
meaningless tweets and catchy headlines we’ve lost the ability to distinguish between serious and senseless.
When horrific events do occur, the media world (i.e. all of us) is lost for words. “Our most powerful
language has been sold too cheaply.” 

How is it possible that we use the same language to express our feelings about a software update *and* the
massacre of hundreds of people?

It’s time that we begin picking our online friends based not just on *what* say they, but *how* they say it.
If you need superlatives, drama and hyperbole to talk about your design taste, last night’s football game or
your favourite burger, consider me a “casualty of your explosive language”.
