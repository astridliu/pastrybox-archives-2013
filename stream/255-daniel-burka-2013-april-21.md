Nine years ago, I sent a tentatively worded email to Doug Bowman asking if he’d meet up for a coffee when I
visited San Francisco for work. At the time, Doug had just launched the new Hotwired site, which was the most
incredible, amazing, mind-blowing achievement in web standards at the time. No way did I think that Doug would
agree to get coffee with a handful of nobodies from Eastern Canada.

And then he responded. And said yes! And even knew some of the work we’d done (or was generous enough to
look us up on the way to the café). And he didn’t talk down to us. And he treated us like COLLEAGUES, not
like disciples. And he was just a human.

I’m not exaggerating when I describe this as a seminal moment in my design career. The fact that Doug Bowman
treated me like I belonged in the same league allowed me to believe that maybe I really did play in the same
league. What a wonderful boost of confidence!

I learned two things that day:

 *  Go out of your way to make time for people and treat them as your peers – it can make a huge
difference.

 *  Doug Bowman is a thoughtful, kind person. Thanks again Doug.
