I hate gamification. Gamification is unethical, exploitative and counter-productive. Alfie Kohn has written a
great book called Punished by Rewards which outlines why extrinsic rewards can ruin the values you are trying
to promote by devaluing them to points, stars, coins or credits. If you are thinking about adding gamification
to your product, you should really, really consider the consequences. You might get a short-term boost, but
any long-term value is lost. These are very important aspects to consider as you are either trying to extract
the most money or work out of a player before they quit or trying to build up a community of dedicated fans
for a lifetime. Slapping badges on things seems to be what everyone is doing, with detrimental affects. I
implore you to think about how this will affect your community and fans.
