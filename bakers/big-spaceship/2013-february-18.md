If you’re holding yourself accountable for avoiding jargon, you might want to do the same with the people
you are working with. Don’t be afraid to ask what things mean rather than secretly looking them up on
Wikipedia later. When a meeting is going around in circles, it might be time to stop and ask the room to
define what exactly “a big idea” or “responsive design” means to them. While there may technically be
a correct definition for terms like this, many times it’s unclear or subjective.
