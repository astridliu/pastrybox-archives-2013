Much of Big Spaceship is a self-organizing organism. There are tools and systems in place but each team works
the way it wants to. If you’ve been in an agency that’s process-oriented (functional or dysfunctional), it
takes a little time to acclimatize to this type of environment. The values, however, are immediately
digestible:

 *  Collaborate

 *  Produce exceptional work

 *  Take care of each other

 *  Partner with your client

 *  “The rest is up to you.”

Now, if you’ve read ‘The Innovators Dilemma’, you’ll know the benefit of this: the team structure and
values allow for various iterations of a company to happen in the one company. Granted, there’s still a
cultural overlay to the teams (we all work together, many people live in Brooklyn, many wear plaid and have
faux-hawks), however, it allows for different approaches to evolve over time.
