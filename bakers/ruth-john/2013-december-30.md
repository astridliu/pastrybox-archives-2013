Like __New Year’s Resolutions__ but instead of one big ‘change my life’ deal, smaller *rules* to include
in my every day life.

It all started one drunken night last weekend, when I came home, headed to bed, realised I was desperate for
the toilet and thought climbing over the radiator at the end of the bed was the quickest and easiest way to
go.

Until I fell over it.

And through my dressing table.

I still have a bruise all the way up the back of my leg.

Am I sharing too much?

Let’s back track slightly; on top of my dressing table is a little wooden stand which holds all my earrings,
in nice neat little rows. Ashamedly*, (*that’s a lie I’m not ashamed), it holds about 50 or so pairs
(don’t worry I only wear one pair at a time), so the whole thing ended up in one tangled mess on the
floor.

I had just cleaned and tidied that morning, I really was not in the mood the next day to sit there, sort
through all the mixed up pairs and clean it all up.

So I made myself a rule.

Every time I went into my room I had to move/sort/tidy at least one item of jewellery, I couldn’t leave my
room without doing this.

So far I haven’t. I’m on my third day of living by this rule today and I’ve cleared about 50% of the
mess. Considering I haven’t set aside any specific time for this task, which is my usual way of organising,
I’m feeling pretty good.

So good, in fact, that I’ve started to let it leak into other tasks. I have about 3,000 unread emails
sitting in my inbox, (I know, I know, I can see your OCD is making you twitch), which I keep meaning to set
aside some time to sort. New rule, every day  when I check my emails, I sort out a previous days worth.

I made my mum a cardi. I now have to block this cardi. (If you’re not familiar with the granny arts of
knitting and crochet, blocking is basically wetting and stretching the finished article before the first
wear).

It’s huge and before I block it, I need to weave in all the ends (where I finished a ball of wool and
started another), there’s more than a few ends, so every time I go downstairs, I weave some in. It should be
ready for blocking this evening.

Right now, I’m wondering what other tasks I can complete with this new rule, and whether I will actually
keep it up, or like the inevitable New Year’s Resolution, give up after a month…

I’ll let you know.
