       <p>Like <strong>New Year’s Resolutions</strong> but instead of one big ‘change my life’ deal, smaller <em>rules</em> to include in my every day life.</p><p>It all started one drunken night last weekend, when I came home, headed to bed, realised I was desperate for the toilet and thought climbing over the radiator at the end of the bed was the quickest and easiest way to go.</p><p>Until I fell over it.</p><p>And through my dressing table.</p><p>I still have a bruise all the way up the back of my leg.</p><p>Am I sharing too much?</p><p>Let’s back track slightly; on top of my dressing table is a little wooden stand which holds all my earrings, in nice neat little rows. Ashamedly*, (*that’s a lie I’m not ashamed), it holds about 50 or so pairs (don’t worry I only wear one pair at a time), so the whole thing ended up in one tangled mess on the floor.</p><p>I had just cleaned and tidied that morning, I really was not in the mood the next day to sit there, sort through all the mixed up pairs and clean it all up.</p><p>So I made myself a rule.</p><p>Every time I went into my room I had to move/sort/tidy at least one item of jewellery, I couldn’t leave my room without doing this.</p><p>So far I haven’t. I’m on my third day of living by this rule today and I’ve cleared about 50% of the mess. Considering I haven’t set aside any specific time for this task, which is my usual way of organising, I’m feeling pretty good.</p><p>So good, in fact, that I’ve started to let it leak into other tasks. I have about 3,000 unread emails sitting in my inbox, (I know, I know, I can see your OCD is making you twitch), which I keep meaning to set aside some time to sort. New rule, every day when I check my emails, I sort out a previous days worth.</p><p>I made my mum a cardi. I now have to block this cardi. (If you’re not familiar with the granny arts of knitting and crochet, blocking is basically wetting and stretching the finished article before the first wear).</p><p>It’s huge and before I block it, I need to weave in all the ends (where I finished a ball of wool and started another), there’s more than a few ends, so every time I go downstairs, I weave some in. It should be ready for blocking this evening.</p><p>Right now, I’m wondering what other tasks I can complete with this new rule, and whether I will actually keep it up, or like the inevitable New Year’s Resolution, give up after a month…</p><p>I’ll let you know.</p>
