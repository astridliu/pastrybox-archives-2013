When I was consulting, I measured my work in hours. I’d guess how long something would take, add a small
amount of slack, do the work, and then measure against my estimates. Did I charge fairly? Am I good at
guessing how long something takes? Am I profitable?

But now, back in the world of salaries, I find this model to be a bit unfair to myself and what I want out of
life. More and more, I’m measuring my work from the energy I have at the end of the day. Do I have
enough energy to explore new ideas, learn something everyday, and keep my motivation going? Do the people I
work with bring me up or wear me out? Will this project ship—and if it does, will it help people?

Energy is hard to measure. It’s a gut feeling. An end-of-the-day question: was that the best use of my
time?
