A couple of weeks ago, [Adam Michela](https://twitter.com/soopa) and I were talking about the design process.
He said something that was revelatory for me, and I’m still working through it.

We were talking about systems and how we try to make them extensible. When it’s finally time to ship a
product, things start getting weird. All those hours and conversations start to unravel. Every last-minute
change feels like a punch in the gut. I said, “I hate it when people do things without thinking about their
implications.”

“But *that’s* why we are designers,” Adam said. “Because we can see those implications and think
through them.”

It was a Friday afternoon. I was tired. I went home and rested. But Adam got me thinking, how do we embrace
the mess? Or should we?

If we notice things most people don’t, what kind of responsibility does that give us?
