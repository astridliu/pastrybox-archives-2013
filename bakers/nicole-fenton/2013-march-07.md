I like change, which means I switch up how I write once in a while. I move furniture first or go for a photo
walk. I draw boxes on a whiteboard or type directly into text fields. I think out loud to hear my own voice. I
ask questions and listen to other people’s feelings and ideas.

These patterns come from different things around me, like my environment, friends, and how I’ve been
feeling. Writing is a personal and subjective practice. As we change, our styles and interests do too. With
that in mind, here are three patterns I’ve noticed in myself lately:

 *  Wait until the end of the day to write something personal. When you’re completely exhausted, it’s
easier to speak from the heart.

 *  Don’t worry if your work isn’t perfect. Focus on the feelings you want to convey, even if they’re
fuzzy at first. Cover what you care about. Then, fill in the facts, reread what you wrote, and edit for
details.

 *  Talk with people a lot more than you think you can. You’ll be a better human for it and your work will
improve too.

So what about you? What kinds of patterns do you find yourself following these days? [I’d love to hear about
them](http://twitter.com/nicoleslaw), whether about writing or anything else.
