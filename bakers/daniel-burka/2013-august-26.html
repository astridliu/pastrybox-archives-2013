       <p>What do <a href="https://twitter.com/stop">Doug Bowman</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/veen">Jeff Veen</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/trammell">Mark Trammell</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jazer">John Zeratsky</a> all have in common? Well, on the surface they’re all four handsome, talented, well-respected designers. But look deeper into their pasts and you’ll notice that each of them studied Journalism earlier in their careers.</p><p>When you get old and crotechety like me, you frequently get asked by younger people what schools or programs you’d suggest. As the careers of Doug, Jeff, Mark, and John attest, you could certainly do worse than J-School (or, as I did, a History degree).</p><p>Particularly now that there are numerous programs specifically tailored for digital design, why would I recommend studying Journalism?</p><p><strong>Telling stories</strong> <br /></b>As trite and overstated as it sounds, design is all about telling stories. Journalists fundamentally learn not only how to tell a story, but how to identify which stories are worth telling.</p><p><strong>Copy is interface</strong> <br /></b>Copywriting is the most underappreciated component of digital design. Every time you stick Lorem Ipsum into a mockup or wait for your official copywriter to provide you with words, you’re cheating a little bit. I would not hire a designer who couldn’t write. Journalists, pretty much by definition, are writers.</p><p><strong>Don’t bury the lede</strong> <br /></b>One of the keys to telling a strong story in journalism is to capture your audience’s attention early. Like on the web, readers are fickle and have short attention spans. Great journalists know how to use a great lede to hook their reader early in every piece.</p><p><strong>Research</strong> <br /></b>All good journalism is built on rock-solid research. Even journalists who work within a specific subject write a huge volume of work on tight deadlines. They learn how to do research on a subject quickly and thoroughly.<p><strong>Know your audience</strong> <br /></b>In journalism, as in design, you’re creating for an audience. Knowing your audience’s interests and knowledge level is crucial to being successful.</p><p><strong>Manage constraints</strong> <br /></b>Word-counts, timelines, styleguides, budgets, editors, internal politics. Journalists balance all of these constraints to be successful.</p><p><strong>Work on a deadline</strong> <br />Journalists are frequently writing under extremely tight time contsraints. Unlike us lucky History students, the kids in J-School rarely had the leisure of producing a term paper over a 3 month period. Executing well under pressure, over and over again, should never be under-estimated.</p>
