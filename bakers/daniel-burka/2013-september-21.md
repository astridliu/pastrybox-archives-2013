The thesis for Richard Sennet’s book The Craftsman is wonderfully simple: “Making is thinking.” I love
this.

I’m constantly meeting people who claim to have the next great idea. You express the idea in a presentation
with plenty of charts explaining how the idea will disrupt everything we take for granted. You have irrational
confidence in your idea before the making process has even begun. You don’t have an idea — you just have
an inkling.

It is in the making that your little, encouraging inkling will mature into an idea. Over the first few months
that you’re making, you’ll decide a thousand big and small questions that will fertilize your inkling. You
may graft one inkling to another. You may plant a few inklings, grow them for a while, and then choose to
focus on one.

And the best part is that it’s easier than ever to fertilize an inkling. Prototyping tools put power into
the hands of non-engineers. Coding is easier to pick up than ever before. User testing and analytics are
approachable to anyone. And, the cost of all of your tools has been driven way down. Don’t gingerly hold
onto your inkling, waiting for funding or for someone else to build it for you. Jump in with both hands, ready
to make your inkling into an idea.
