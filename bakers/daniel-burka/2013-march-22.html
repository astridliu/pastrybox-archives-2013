       <p>Recently, I was working on a project with the wonderful team at <a href="http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/">Blue Bottle Coffee</a>. One member of their crew was talking about their (notably wonderful) in-café experience and likened it to a swimming swan: a swan presents a self-controlled elegant appearance above the surface even as her flippers are paddling like mad underwater propelling her forward.</p><p>I love how directly applicable the swan metaphor is to product development. Great product designers and engineers go to great lengths to make their products appear effortless. It’s truly incredible that my wife is nonplussed that a Google search with only the four letters “ZAZI” will give her directions, opening times, and a reliable rating of a restaurant a mile away&hellip; even though she mistyped its name&hellip; in 300ms&hellip; across the entire corpus of the internet! No big deal. It just took hundreds (thousands?) of engineers a decade to make this miraculous achievement possible. This is the quintessential swan. All of that effort underwater to make something appear eminently easy.</p><p>Look for ways in your own products to do the extra legwork on the design and engineering front to give people that effortless experience.<p class="footnote">* Note that this swan metaphor isn’t a new concept. In fact, I feel like I might be the last person on earth to hear it, especially since it seems so obvious after little explanation. For instance, Danny Meyer, a well-known New York restaurateur behind Shake Shack, invokes it in his book <cite><a href="http://amzn.com/0060742763">Setting the Table</a></cite>.<br />** The swan metaphor has also been used to describe the negative behavior of masking one’s panic—see the <a href="http://assuhealthblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/duck-syndrome.html">Stanford Duck Syndrome</a>. This is also very useful in the designer’s workplace, but probably another topic entirely.</p>
