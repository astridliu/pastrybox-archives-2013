       <p>When Alex approached me to write for The Pastry Box, I replied with this image</p><p><img src="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/horse-ebooks-who-else-wants-to-become-a-golf-ball.jpg" alt="horse-ebooks-who-else-wants-to-become-a-golf-ball" width="773" height="290" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7190 framed" /></p><p>and asked if I could present one thought from my Twitter for each month of the project.</p><p>He thought I was joking.</p><p>I wasn’t.</p><p>The Internet is a wonderful thing, but it also means every living human being now has a bully pulpit to type words that anyone in the world can read. Probably on Facebook. At any given moment, for the first time in human civilization, it’s possible to immerse yourself in social interaction with other human beings all over the planet, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year.</p><p>Sometimes I just get tired of all these people, telling me all these things, sharing their opinions about everything and anything that happened in their day. </p><p>I have a message for all these people.</p><p>Shut the fuck up.</p><p>Now I mean this in a gentle way, with great tenderness. Imagine I’m holding you in my arms, we’re both cradling warm cups of tea with a soft down blanket enveloping us both, watching Nights in Rodanthe on DVD… and l lean down, nuzzling your cheek a bit as I slowly whisper in your ear…</p><p>Shut the fuck up.</p><p>Not every thought should be shared.<br />Not every opinion needs to be voiced.<br />The world does not benefit from yet more unconstructive, random chatter.</p><p>This is why there is a growing <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=don't+read+the+comments">Don’t Read the Comments</a> movement. Which I find profoundly sad, because I love human communication and I love comments. But too many people engage their mouths long before their brains are in gear, and fill the world with the worst kind of noise.</p><p>Which is why I love Twitter.</p><p>The 140 character limitation may be the best thing that’s ever happened to general human communication. We don’t have to suffer through long tirades, or boring exposition, or a bunch of blah blah blah happy talk before getting to the freaking <em>point</em>. There’s only room for the point! If you can only write one thing, you write the most important part, the title. Make it an interesting title that explains what’s going on. Boom. Done.</p><p>Which is what you’re supposed to do in good writing anyway. The great accidental genius of Twitter is that it demands good writing. It presents a small, simple box which implicitly says: <strong>Be interesting. Be succinct. Be clear. Or you will be ignored.</strong></p><p>So when I submitted 11 Twitter posts to The Pastry Box, it wasn’t some kind of bizarre performance art. It wasn’t me cheating my way out of writing 11 monthly pieces. (OK, it was maybe that a <em>little</em>.) But mostly, it was me taking my own advice, and … shutting the fuck up.</p><p>You’re welcome.</p>
