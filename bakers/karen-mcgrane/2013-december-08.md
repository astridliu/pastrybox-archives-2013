My friend and lawyer, Alison, has the unenviable task of talking me down when I get screwed over by a client
or business partner. My strategy is to whine piteously “*but it’s not fair!*” and then she explains how
to use each incident as a learning experience so I can avoid making similar mistakes in the future. She also
explains that sometimes people are selfish jerks and life is not fair, but she does it in a way that gives me
hope for a better future.

I recently walked away from participating in something I loved to do, under circumstances I found both galling
and unkind. I went to Alison with my familiar refrain, “*but it’s not fair!*” Why should I be the one to
step aside? Why am I the one taking a professional backstep? Why do I watch from the sidelines, while the
wicked and untrustworthy prosper? Alison just looked at me, shrugged and said:

*Integrity comes at a price.*

Integrity doesn’t come from the easy stuff. It’s effortless for me to think of myself as a person of
integrity, simply by not doing things I don’t really want to do.

That job torturing puppies sure would make a lot of money! But I won’t take it, because *I have
integrity.*

I could so easily push this old woman down and steal her purse. I won’t. You know why? *Integrity.*

Child labor laws are for *suckers.* Surely any competent ten-year-old could do this content audit, and I could
pay her in candy! Alas, I can’t do that, *because of my integrity.*

Integrity comes in the hard choices, from saying *no* to things you wish you could say *yes* to. It’s
refusing to take a project you might enjoy and that would pay well, because you don’t respect the values of
the organization. It’s walking away from a business partnership that offers you significant benefits in
terms of exposure and collaboration, because you learn your business partner is not a man of integrity. It’s
ending a friendship with a person you genuinely like, because you realize she doesn’t truly have your back.


Integrity means living with the right choice when every fiber of your being is shrieking *but it’s not
fair.*

Integrity comes at a price. *And it’s worth it.*

Business relationships come to an end. There’s always another project, another client, another conference.
Friendships come and go. 

Your relationship with yourself is forever. There is power in knowing what you will say no to. The world may
never be fair to you, but you can be fair to yourself.
