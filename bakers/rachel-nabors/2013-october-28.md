I grew up on a rural farm in Virginia’s Blue Ridge Mountains. We had calves, chickens, geese, all kinds of
animals. They had to have pens to forage and play in. And if you leave animals on one tract of land for too
long, they trample the ground and turn it into a dirt lot. So we practiced pasture rotation: one part of the
pasture would stay fenced off until it had recovered enough, until it was ready for grazing again.

Now, the odd thing was that these animals always wanted to get at the sweet, new grass and vegetation on the
fallow side of the fence. They’d reach their necks through whenever they could, nibbling on the greens,
leaving a strip of grass cropped so neatly you’d think we were trimming the fenceline with a pair of nail
clippers. 

When the time came to let them into the fresh field, we’d take down the dividing fence or open the pasture
gate wide. But so often the animals didn’t understand that they were free to roam in this promised land
they’d yearned for so long. They would act as though the fence or gate were still there, invisible, holding
them back. 

We’re all guilty of this. I’ve had clients come to me and say, “build this so it works on everything!”
In response, I ask, “What browsers do your analytics say your users are visiting with?” If analytics have
been gathering data properly, we can then see which pastures are open to us. But all too often we operate on
defaults, mentally blocking out tools that could help us because we’ve gotten used to rejecting them out of
hand for so long. “I can’t implement this because it doesn’t work in this browser well/at all. I’ll do
what always works.” Sometimes we still implement polyfills long after the need for them is gone, like calves
reaching under a fence to nibble grass while the gate hangs wide.

To get the geese and calves to go into the new pasture, I’d have to herd (and sometimes carry!) them into
the fresh pasture several times until it “stuck.” How often I would try to herd a calf through an open
gate only to have the poor thing dig in her heels as though I were trying to force her against a wall!

Often we’re slow to discard our mental blocks. When we don’t push the envelope, we need to do less
researching, less arguing for our cause during meetings. We have fewer promises to live up to. We can stay in
the familiar, the pasture we know well, and look dolefully at the pasture we wish we had. “If only it
weren’t for those barriers.” 

We wait until we see many other companies implementing what we thought were “experimental and unreliable”
over and over before we start imitating them. We wait to follow the leaders instead of being leaders. And
there are often good reasons for that. There’s no point in building something no one can use yet. But if we
don’t try to push the envelope, browsers won’t prioritize those features we yearn for.

We had a pair of white Chinese geese, the domesticated relatives of the Chinese Swan Goose. (The Swan Goose,
it should be mentioned, is imperiled by the intermingling of domestic and wild genes.) They were tall and
elegant, shrill, and they knew that Geese Were Not Humans. The other geese were somewhat dubious of this
belief, but followed them around as the de facto leaders because they were also *the smartest geese*. Or at
least the most motivated! Aidan and Aida could find a way out of any pasture we put the flock into. My mother
and I would run around, plugging gaps in the fence a goose could only squeeze through if it thought like a
cat. But the miniature velociraptors would show up a few hours later, parading the entire band of geese down
the road in triumph. Eventually we managed to plug all their escape hatches, but the pair still caused us so
much grief that we sold them. The flock was much more friendly and content without their promises of goose
Valhalla just outside the grasp of Man.

There are people, and I fall in with this lot, who just cannot stop shooting for the moon. They want to do all
the things now, and if one browser doesn’t support it, the bug tickets start flying. Do we get the flock in
trouble? Yes. But if it weren’t for our misadventures, everyone would still be moping around in that boring
old pen.

This year I went on a marathon of interviews. I was surprised when I bombed some because I just wasn’t
strong enough in JavaScript, yet the team members really loved what I was doing in my side projects with
experimental CSS and APIs. But I understood. While the farmer needs her geese to stay in the pen, her geese
appreciate a goose that can wiggle out of the pen and lead them to green pastures. In the same way, companies
need front end developers that slot in and pull equally with the team, but individual developers can
appreciate the cleverness of one another’s work.

Browsers are capable of some amazing things these days, yet so many developers remain staunchly in their pens,
either detained by their handlers or by their own blindness to the open gate. My advice? Be a wiggly goose,
and sneak out when you get the chance. You *and your flock* will be glad you did.
