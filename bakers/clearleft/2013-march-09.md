# The False Dilemma

Today, I asked myself the question “Why do we often form extreme opinions on things, when in reality our
opinion often lies in the midground”. I have little knowledge of psychology, but it seems that humans
find it difficult to make reasoned decisions to complex problems (problems with many possible outcomes) and so
often rely on intuition to solve them. But when a binary alternative offers itself, we will often take the
shortcut and assume there are no alternative solutions. It is also far more easy to communicate the simple
binary answer than the complex one.

For example, if you ask someone whether they like cats or dogs, they will very often answer with one or the
other. The reality is never so simple. All people somewhat like/dislike cats and somewhat like/dislike dogs.
Nobody likes all cats and nobody likes all dogs. This is an example of false dilemma, as there are more than
two answers. Very few things are black and white, and yet we find it hard to acknowledge this.

Take the digital industry for example, I see false dilemma everywhere. We all make quick decisions on how to
do things and then forget why we made that decision. One rule rarely fits all, and yet people often shoehorn a
process, technology, framework or mindset into every project they work on. Some of the best craftspeople out
there will make very few assumptions, as few as possible. Every decision will be reasoned, and based on the
specific needs of the product they are creating. The design will flourish out of a multitude of nuanced
decisions, bespoke to this one set of constraints.

We must also be ready to evolve, and I think we are much better at this. Generally, people in the digital
industry embrace new technology and adopt it into their workflow. But perhaps we could still do better,
especially when it comes to an evolving understanding in the nature of digital and what it means to people.
Look around you, and see what everyone else is learning. Be ready to reassess your assumptions and move
forwards. It doesn’t necessarily mean you were wrong, but that your understanding of how digital
products are used can always be improved. Besides, we’re all designing for a world which is constantly
in a state of flux. What was true yesterday need not be true today.

But perhaps the most important thing I want to highlight here, is that the answer to most questions is [it
depends](http://adactio.com/journal/4437/), and very often in the grey area between black and white. Try not
to take extreme views on things, and perhaps see that there is always another level of complexity to be
discovered in any decision you make.
