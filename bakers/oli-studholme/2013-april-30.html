       <h1>Have a reason</h1><p>Graphic design is an odd bird. It’s part art and part science, and often treated as mostly decorative. But armed with your favorite tools of the trade, it’s also very satisfying.</p><p>Teaching myself graphic design as a student, I created layouts based on what felt good. I was into that edgy, “creative” stuff. If you’ve got a great eye that may be enough, but now I also use this design golden rule: <strong>have a reason</strong>. Typography, grid-based layout, and basic design principles (balance, hierarchy, scale…) are essential foundations of great graphic design. Instead of throwing elements at a canvas and seeing what sticks, use these fundamentals to place them deliberately. Have a reason for every design decision. By doing so, you’ll increase <em>resonance</em> in a design.</p><p>In contrast, small differences (such as almost identical font sizes, or slightly unaligned objects) detract from this, often appearing as mistakes even if intentional. This gives me another rule: <strong>make differences obvious</strong>. If you’re going to break the rules (of your grid etc.), do so deliberately and make it count. Luckily, building a strong chorus of resonance in your design causes deliberate differences to stand out even more sharply.</p><p>Having a reason behind everything you do gives your work depth and subtlety. It shows you’ve thought carefully about each aspect, and lets you explain each decision.</p><p>Have a reason.</p>
