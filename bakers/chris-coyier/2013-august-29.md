Blogs were the first round of social media on the web. Medium length writing with links and images and
such.

Then we got Facebook. We still write, but it’s shorter and doesn’t have the complexities of running a
blog.

Then Twitter, just 140 characters of text. Even simpler, but you still have to write.

Then Instagram, where you just have to point your phone at something.

Then Pinterest, where you don’t even have to take the photo you just post other people’s photos.

I think the input mechanic for the next popular social network will be that you just have to grunt approvingly
at something.
