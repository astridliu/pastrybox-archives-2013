I get into a lot of fights on Twitter. Usually with right-wing freaks, the morally uptight, some form of
Christian fundamentalist, etc. I’ve picked fights with the Susan Komen Foundation, the Romney campaign, and
assorted Tea Partiers. I probably enjoy it more than I should.

But let me tell you about one fight I regret. I was on a cross-country flight. Bored out of my mind. Checking
twitter. Saw a tweet from some random guy linking to a post he’d written about unfollowing me. Now, I could
give a rat’s ass about someone unfollowing me, but the fact that he felt inclined to write a post about it,
coupled with the fact that I was stuck in coach for six hours unleashed the asshole within.

I started a fight with the guy, he engaged, and before I knew it I’d worked up a scheme where I was trying
to get him to 1000 followers by the end of my flight, (He had maybe 100 to start with.) with the sole purpose
of getting all those new followers to unfollow him the next day at the same time. 

The next day I looked over this guy’s reply stream and it was full of hate and vitriol and name calling. I
felt sick. I was responsible for that. I worked people into a frenzy and urged them to pick on this guy.

I did something stupid and behaved like a bully. I punched down.

Why am I bringing this up now? Because it was probably the shittiest thing I’ve ever done online. And people
let me know it. I was called names. I was told I did a terrible thing. And I deserved it. And it was fair.


It was a measured response. 

I want to be a better person. For the sake of the people around me. For the sake of my son. For my own
well-being and happiness. I want to treat others the way I hope they would treat me. Sadly, I know myself too
well. I’m going to fall short of that goal on a lot of days. And to varying degrees, we all will. And when I
do I’ll deserve to be called out. I’ll deserve to be called names. I’ll deserve to be insulted.

But we all deserve a measured response.

Because when your response is worse than the action that elicits it, then who’s the asshole?
