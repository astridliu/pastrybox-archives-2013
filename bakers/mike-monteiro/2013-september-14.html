       <h1>Frank the Dairy Farmer</h1><p>His whole life Frank had wanted to be a dairy farmer.</p><p>He grew up on a small farm where his father grew a couple of crops and raised a few animals. Of all the animals Frank loved the cow best. And in time, with help from his mother, he learned to milk it. </p><p>So when Frank grew up he moved to the valley, found himself a job, and managed to save up enough for a small piece of dirt and some cows. And he set himself up milking those cows, who he took good care of. The cows rewarded Frank for his love by producing enough milk that Frank set up a little store next to his farm and began selling milk to his neighbors. </p><p>Frank made enough money at the little store that he bought a few more cows and started selling his milk to the folk in the nearest town. And Frank got himself a little truck to make deliveries. And hired a few local folk to help him milk the cows, who he always treated well.</p><p>Frank grew to love delivering milk and seeing the smiling faces of his customers as much as he loved milking cows and he decided he wanted to make even more people happy. He wanted to supply the entire valley with milk.</p><p>So he approached the rich gentlemen of the valley. He put together a deck. And a five-year plan. And got his finances in order. And put on his best suit. And invited the rich gentlemen of the valley over to his farm. He gave them a tour. Showed them his cows. And they all sat down to a big glass of milk with a slice of pie, which his wife had made using butter she’d churned from their cows’ milk.</p><p>And when they finished their pie, Frank stood up to make his presentation but one of the rich gentlemen of the valley cut him off and said, “We’ve seen all we need to see, Frank. We’re not investing in your farm. We’re investing in <em>you!</em>”</p><p>And they wrote him a check.</p><p>Which Frank used to buy the adjacent plot of land, buy 100 more cows, and expand his milk delivery area to include more of the towns in the valley.</p><p>And the people of the valley were happy for Frank’s milk. They were even happier when he started to deliver butter, cheese and ice cream as well.</p><p>And the rich gentlemen of the valley were happy with their investment. And on occasion would drop by the dairy farm to check on Frank. And the cows. And often suggested that Frank buy more cows. And they wrote more checks. Which Frank would use to buy what the gentlemen told him to buy. After all, he owed his success to the rich gentlemen of the valley.</p><p>And the day came when the rich gentlemen of the valley suggested to Frank that it was time to expand <em>beyond</em> the valley. They introduced him to rich gentlemen who lived beyond the valley. He gave them a tour. Showed him his cows. And they all sat down to a big glass of milk with a slice of pie, which his wife had made using butter she’d churned from their cows’ milk.</p><p>And when they finished their pie, Frank stood up to make his presentation but one of the rich gentlemen who lived beyond the valley cut him off and said, “We’ve seen all we need to see, Frank. We’re not investing in your farm. We’re buying it. The papers are all signed.” And all the gentlemen who weren’t Frank shook hands and lit cigars as trucks drove up, loaded up Frank’s cows and drove them to a slaughterhouse.</p>
