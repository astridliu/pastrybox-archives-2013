# The Most Difficult Design Conversation You’ll Ever Have

You are sitting in your client’s office. Or on the phone with them. It doesn’t really matter. What matters
is they are giving you feedback. You are proud of your work. You did the research. You can explain your
choices. You can tie them back to the goals that were set at the beginning of the project. You are a good
designer. You dotted your i’s, crossed your t’s, and remembered to use real honest-to-goodness
apostrophes. 

And now they are giving you feedback. It is not good. They are ignoring the research. They are ignoring your
rationale. They are not just telling you *what* to change, they are telling you *how* to change it. And you
know that these changes will lead to nothing good. They’re not right. They’re going to have an impact on
the potential success of the project. You know because you’ve done this before. And because you’re a good
designer.

And like a good designer you try to explain your rationale. You explain why you made a certain choice. You
explain how it contributes to the goals. And you explain how their changes undermine the goals. *Their* goals.
And they tell you to do it the way they just told you to do it anyway.

And you think to yourself this is the most difficult design conversation you’ve ever had. And you start
thinking you should give in. Fuck the rationale. If you give them whatever they want, this conversation ends
that much quicker.

Which is true. What’s *not* true is that this is the most difficult design conversation you’ll ever have.
That one comes six months down the road. 

That conversation comes after you’ve done everything the client asked you to do, even the things you knew
were terrible ideas. And the project fails, and the client calls you into their office and says “the project
failed”. And you say “I knew it would, but I did everything you asked me to do anyway because I was scared
of getting fired and scared of upsetting you.”

Because both of those things are about to happen, sport. 

So why not risk them happening while there is still a chance to solve the problem correctly? Before you’ve
blown the project budget, before you’ve wrecked the project schedule, before you’ve cost other people
their jobs by not doing yours.
