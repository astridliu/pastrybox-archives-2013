# Welcome, Recent Graduates

It is with great pride that I welcome you to the workforce. I realize many of you are still preparing for
finals. Getting your portfolios together. Preparing oral defenses. That sort of thing. But I’m guessing that
right below the surface of those immediate and real concerns, the anxiety of what comes next may have started
to take hold. 

It’s cool. I am here to help you. I am a job creator. And contrary to what you may have been told in school,
you are about to enter a market awash in opportunity. Especially if you’re entering the technology and
interactive design market. Which doesn’t mean that you’re not gonna have to go out there and nail an
interview—because you will. So if you’ll give me a few minutes of your precious time I have a few tips
that may help you land the job of your dreams.

 *  __Get your house in order__

Don’t even think about looking for a job without an online presence. If you’re a designer you better have
an online portfolio. If you’re a developer, show me some code samples. And don’t just show me your work is
pretty, describe what problems you were solving.

And as much as I hate to say this, get a LinkedIn profile. Otherwise, prospective employers are gonna look at
your Facebook page, which should be cleaned up but not to the point where it’s *obvious* you’ve cleaned it
up. Leave a beer bong shot or two.

Buy a decent outfit to interview in. Tights aren’t pants and flip flops aren’t shoes.

 *  __Where are these jobs at, fool?__

Good question. There are a few excellent job boards you should get familiar with. Start with [Authentic
Jobs](http://www.authenticjobs.com) and [37 Signals Job Board](http://jobs.37signals.com). Stay away from
Craigslist and stuff like that, they’re shit shows. 

 *  __Get names__

When you finally find a job you want to apply for do some research. Find out the name of the person who’ll
be receiving your email. Hint: They’re not called Hiring Manager. (Also, if you assume the hiring manager is
a man, you suck.) If it’s a small shop, just address it to the principal by name. Don’t address your
letter to the dog, even if the company is stupid enough to list a dog on their website with the rest of the
staff.  

 *  __Even better, network__

“Networking” is kind of a gross word. It’s true. But, nepotism is real and making those connections will
serve you throughout the duration of your career. Hiring can feel like an exhausting crapshoot. People hire
their friends and their friends’ friends before they start picking random strangers from the
jobs@company.com inbox. Tell everyone you know what sort of job you are looking for and ask for introductions
to anyone they know who works in your desired field. Then, when one of these people is asked “Hey, do you
know anyone looking for a job?” your name will come up.

You can go to a “networking mixer” if you like drinking with sad people in uncomfortable clothes, but it
won’t be nearly as effective as working your existing friends and relatives. Even your professors. They had
dreams once.

 *  __No one wants to read your cover letter.__

Write a good email. The goal of the email is to get an in-person interview. Explain why you’re qualified.
Explain what you’d bring to the job. Sound genuinely excited about this new field you’re entering! Do not
apologize for your lack of experience. It’ll be obvious when you tell me you’ve just graduated from
college. Don’t be overly familiar, no matter how “wacky” you’ve heard the workplace is. You’re not
applying to be anyone’s friend. The fact that you can write a solid, straight-forward email that gets right
to the point and maybe shows just a glimmer of personality goes a long way. 

Put the email in the body of the email. Plain text formatting. Do not attach your letter to the email. I’m
not going to open any of those attachments anyway, and I’m *certainly* not going to open them when I’ve
asked you not to attach anything. I *may* click the link to your website. If your email was well-written.

Also, I’ve never read a resumé in my life. But if you insist on giving me one, don’t lead with
“Photoshop” as a skill. Tell me you know how to combine typefaces and have a solid understanding of color
theory. *That’s* a skill.

 *  __Prepare for the interview__

You got an interview? Fantastic. Time to prepare. Find out as much about the company you’re applying at as
possible. Google them. Read their site. Get familiar with the type of work they do and who they do it for.


Prepare questions for them. At some point during the interview you’ll be asked “Do you have any questions
for us?” You should have some. 

“What’s it like to work here?” is a dumb question. “I notice a lot of your work is in editorial, do
you worry about the economics of that market?” gets you a second interview.

 *  __Dress the part, be the part__

There is a school of thought that says your brilliance will shine through even if you’re wearing a ratty
hoodie and a stained t-shirt. It’s stupid. You’re gonna get some graduation money. Spend it on some decent
clothes to wear to your interview. Your Flickr-stalking/research should tell you whether a suit will impress
or terrify your prospective employers.

Don’t hug any of your interviewers. Before *or* after.

 *  __Not to be a self-serving douchebag, but…__

[Read my book](http://www.abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job). I wrote it just for you. It’s got a ton
of good lessons that will guide you through your career. Trust me on this. It’s $18.00.

 *  __Don’t apply at Facebook__

Seriously, do you think so little of the sacrifice your parents made sending you to college that you’re
willing to just throw your life away?
