       <p>Changing someone&#8217;s opinion often seems like a futile endeavour.</p><p>While I&#8217;ve been designing websites for years, I only began to get involved in the community and attend conferences just under three years ago. When I first saw folks arguing on Twitter about the low number of women speaking at events, I was pretty quick to pipe up and say something I&#8217;ve heard so many others say — that I didn&#8217;t care about the gender of the speaker so long as they were qualified.</p><p>As time went on, though, I started to question my opinion. What exactly does being &#8220;qualified&#8221; mean, anyway? Who gets to decide that Designer A is more &#8220;qualified&#8221; to speak than Designer B, especially if both are considered successful in their field? </p><p>Having diversity in your conference lineup does not mean you are sacrificing the quality of the speakers, for I now believe that every hard-working person in this industry can bring something to the table that someone else can learn from.</p><p>Open your mind and listen to what others say without immediately dismissing them, no matter how passionate you feel about a topic — you just might find yourself with some changed opinions of your own. Mine certainly changed, and I&#8217;m glad it did.</p>
