I really like the idea of doing one thing and doing it well.

I’ll admit that I was one of those people who wanted to learn how to do absolutely everything, but I’m
getting much better at controlling where I spend my time and effort. Once upon a time, I wanted to learn
Flash, software development, After Effects, 3D modelling—the list went on. It was even difficult for me to
drop the “Photographer” title on my business card when I went freelance. But these days, I prefer to focus
on illustration and web design only. 

Introducing too many products or services can weaken your brand *and* the quality of your work if you aren’t
careful. 

I remember when I was obsessed with Threadless and had a wish list of t-shirts I was going to buy. These days,
I don’t even bother looking at the website. There’s too much stuff—too many contests, too many types of
products, and what I think to be too many sub-par designs. Call me picky, but I feel like the overall quality
of the basic idea—their t-shirt, has gone downhill over the past couple of years. It doesn’t feel special
or exciting anymore.

Remember the time when there were six versions of Windows Vista, and one version of OS X? Giving customers too
many choices can be overwhelming and confusing. If you do it, you’d damn well better make sure you do it
right and never allow it to affect the quality.

I just got back from New York City and noticed the same idea in shops—one of my favourites being One Girl
Cookies in Brooklyn. Don’t go there and expect to get a Starbucks-sized menu, because you’re not going to
find it. One Girl Cookies is arguably famous for their delicious whoopie pies, and besides their namesake
cookies, you might find only one cake option per day. They know what their customers come for, and they do a
fantastic job at keeping consistent quality. 

It can feel stressful in a world where designers and developers are expected to know everything about
everything. I’m certainly not advising for a designer to not bother learning code, or for a developer to not
care about visual details, but try not to lose sight of what really makes you special.
