Throughout my life I’ve struggled with my health and fitness. In high school, I couldn’t walk up a flight
of stairs without being winded. I couldn’t walk to my friend’s house for lunch without breaking a sweat. I
couldn’t get clothes that fit me (at least, not the clothes that I wanted to wear). I hated all those
things, yet I continued to ignore them and carry on with the only lifestyle I was familiar with.

Five years ago I decided that enough was enough. I finally accepted the fact that I was headed down the wrong
path and needed to do something about it. 

Since then, I’ve lost nearly sixty pounds. Not only do I feel more confident, but I feel much healthier —
and that alone is worth the struggle.

The nature of our industry makes it far too easy to slip into the habit of sitting in our chairs and staring
at a screen for hours on end, day in, day out. But what’s the point of making cool stuff if we feel like
garbage in every other way? That’s *my* motivator — I don’t want to feel like garbage anymore. 

Let’s be clear — changing your lifestyle (did I mention I hate the word ‘diet?’) isn’t going to
happen overnight. Baby steps are incredibly important. Set smaller goals so you don’t get discouraged. Work
your exercise plans into your schedule, and never let work interrupt it. Make more time to prepare healthy
meals, and learn how to order healthier options on days when you absolutely must grab some take-out. Read the
labels on everything you buy. Cut back on sugar. Get more sleep. Doing *something* is always better than doing
nothing.

If you don’t know where to start, download an app like My Fitness Pal for keeping a food and exercise diary,
or if you like geeky gadgets, pick up a Fitbit. Find a friend who’ll take on the challenge with you —
it’s always easier when you can hold each other accountable.

Being successful means nothing if you aren’t around to enjoy it in the long run. Let’s start taking better
care of ourselves — not as a New Year’s Resolution, not next week, but right now. Seriously. Those e-mails
can wait.
