“Get used to falling. Pick yourself up quick, and keep moving.”

I fell off my bike recently. It wasn’t too glamourous; though, if I recount the tale, it’d go something
like this:

“I was bombing the fire roads downhill to Kirby Cove in the Marin Headlands. The gravel path had dried out
to loose and chunky rock that made traction a tricky proposition. I have a new bike, so I was excited to take
it out on its maiden voyage. I got a little bike-drunk — riding faster than usual, looser than usual. I took
a corner too hot, and as I was navigating it, the ground slid out beneath me, and there I was on my ass. I
knew it was coming, though.”

I got up immediately. My friends Adam and Bill were there to help and provide support — thanks!

I assessed myself. A big ol’ dime-size patch of skin was barely dangling on my palm, which I immediately
ripped off, to the groans and eeks of my companions. When the adrenaline is pumping, do the worst bits. The
pain hasn’t kicked in yet. I looked at the gravel rash on my left buttock — yep, there were some pebbles
lodged into the abrasion, and I picked them out as much as possible. I took a breath, two, then I jumped back
on the bike and kept descending. 

I never stop too long when something goes awry — just long enough to assess the situation and start making
decisions. Is it something that needs to be fixed, remedied, paid attention to? I move on to problem-solving
quickly. Wallowing is difficult for me; perhaps it’s bad form or somehow I’m not allowing myself to really
*feel* by blindly moving forward, but I march ahead nonetheless.

And that’s the important part. Paying attention to the here and now, but knowing there’s a way through, a
way into the future.
