We all know that it is important to find a good balance between life and work. What doesn’t get shared as
often is how important it is to balance work that inspires you and work that does not. My all-time favorite
quote is from Howard Thurman and he says “Don’t ask what the world needs. Ask what makes you come alive,
and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.”

If you have been watching the activity in the design and dev community over the past couple of years, you will
see countless examples of people who did this. It had never been more apparent to me than a couple of weeks
ago at [Converge SE](http://convergese.com) in Columbia, SC. Every speaker that shared their story on the main
day had a common theme. They worked on something that made them come alive (in addition to their daily job or
work). Doing this led to some big opportunity or career change and ultimately led them to the stage to inspire
us.

On an individual level we see people doing this kind of work (and sharing it) earn new positions or the type
of clients that they really enjoy. At the company level, we see teams that build their own product get picked
up by bigger companies to work on products with more impact. I can’t say how much longer it will last, but
be sure to strike while the iron is hot.

Our industry is spoiled right now. The demand for what we do significantly outweighs the supply of people who
can do it well. The things that we build are creating new industries with new opportunities and shaking up
existing ones. There is work out there that would make you happily get out of the bed in the morning or work
late at night. You just have to show the world that you want it.
