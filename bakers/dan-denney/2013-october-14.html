       <p>I love the story of the <a href="http://thisismadebyhand.com/film/the_knife_maker">The Knife Maker</a>. If you haven’t seen it, please set aside 11 minutes to enjoy it. It is a story about creativity, struggle, and triumph. It’s also about a guy named Joel Bukiewicz. </p><p>This past weekend I was lucky enough to get to meet Joel and his wife, Julia. My wife, Cherrie, and I were exploring Brooklyn on Saturday after I had attended Brooklyn Beta. We wandered in to check out the <a href="http://cutbrooklyn.com">Cut Brooklyn</a> shop during their “open hours” and were greeted by Julia. We shared that we weren’t really in the market for the cutlery but that we had seen the video and were fans. In the background, Joel was putting the finishing touches on one of three knives he planned on releasing that day.</p><p>When he was done, something awesome happened. Julia introduced us and he offered us a tour of the shop downstairs (where the dusty stuff happens). He showed us around, explaining some of the tools and showing where different parts of the process happens. He shared the backstory behind this awesome machine that he had gotten not long ago and that had been sitting in a basement in Brooklyn. He says that the old machines are the best because you can easily find parts and keep them in working order.</p><p>We chatted about Brooklyn and The Maker Movement. He shared some stories about <a href="http://birdsblack.com">Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds</a>, <a href="http://www.brooklyn-homebrew.com">Brooklyn Homebrew</a>, and <a href="http://www.fletchersbklyn.com">Fletcher’s Brooklyn Barbecue</a>. Also, he shared the story of the growth of the areas in Brooklyn. It seems that once a few people open up shops doing interesting things, the people follow. </p><p>He took about 20 minutes out of his day to share these stories with us and then asked us if we wanted to sit and have a beer. We passed so that he could back to making awesome knives (and so we could go get some pie from Four &amp; Twenty Blackbirds).</p><p>I’m sharing this because if you are reading this, you are likely a maker. Joel and Julia represent all of the best things in the people who make up our community. They do something that they believe in, they keep doing it in the face of adversity, they support their community, and they are kind. The story in the video is fantastic and the way it is continuing is, too. </p><p>I want to spread Joel’s enthusiasm for sharing the stories of the others in his community in the hopes that you will do the same for yours. There are most likely makers with wonderful stories in your local area and not everyone gets an awesome videographer to share their story with the world. Seek them out, see if you can find out their story, and share it somehow.  </p>
