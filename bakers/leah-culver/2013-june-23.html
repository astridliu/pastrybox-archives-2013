       <h1>Why I Love iOS 7<span style="font-weight:normal;"><em>What’s your tintColor?</em></span></h1><p>I love the new iOS 7.</p><p>I installed iOS 7 on my iPhone immediately after it was released to developers. My co-workers thought I was crazy.</p><p>“Your primary phone?!” they all asked.</p><p>Yup. I like to live on the edge.</p><p>But seriously, I have a few good reasons to love iOS 7. First, it fixes my number one gripe — that it’s such a hassle to update iPhone applications.</p><p>I wrote a <a href="http://the-pastry-box-project.net/leah-culver/2013-april-9/">whole post on the topic</a> a couple months ago for the Pastry Box Project. I wasn’t too optimistic about ever seeing the problem fixed.</p><blockquote><p>I think ideally your iPhone would download the latest versions of your apps (and iOS) in the background, maybe at times when you’re connected to wifi. However, I don’t see this happening any time soon.</p></blockquote><p>Well, it happened!!</p><p>(If only I could wish features into existence more often…)</p><p>My iPhone now gets the latest versions of my apps automatically. John McCain <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2013/06/10/john-mccain-applauds-tim-cook-for-automatic-app-updates-in-ios-7/">seems pretty excited</a> about this feature too.</p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p>Thanks to Tim Cook for the automatic iphone app updates! <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23apple&amp;src=hash">#apple</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23wwdc&amp;src=hash">#wwdc</a></p>&mdash; John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) <a href="https://twitter.com/SenJohnMcCain/statuses/344187253955907584">June 10, 2013</a></blockquote><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p>Woot.</p><p>Automatic updates seem like such a great idea… but then I worried about the consequences. What if an app updates at a really inconvenient time?</p><p>Today I was waiting in the subway tunnel for my Muni train. No Wi-Fi. I was all ready to start reading a book on my Kindle app when I noticed the Kindle app was stuck in the middle of an update. <strong>Oh no! Code red! Hypothetical situation has become reality!!</strong></p><p>I checked the status of the update in the App Store app and noticed there was an option to “pause” the download. I clicked the button and my Kindle app returned to normal. <strong>Phew.</strong></p><p>In addition to automatic updates, there are a couple other nice features of iOS 7 such as the Control Center and the camera improvements. However, the thing that’s got most people talking is the new design.</p><p>I’m not a designer so I’m not going to get into the layout of the icons or the lack of shadows and bevels. I just wanted to note that I think the design is a huge improvement for developers.</p><p>I downloaded Xcode 5 at the same time as iOS 7 so that I could start developing iOS 7 applications. I was really impressed by how much better all the default styling and components look.</p><p>I’m super happy to see those ugly blue navigations bars and rounded rect buttons bite the dust. I’m ready for change and I’m re-energized to build better looking iPhone apps with iOS 7.</p><p>It’s also just fun to ask, “so what’s your tintColor?”</p>
