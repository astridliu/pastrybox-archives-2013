       <h1>How to Be A Stronger Person</h1><ol><li><p>Take calculated risks — no risk, no reward.</p></li><li><p>Embrace failure but don’t let it define you — failure is your tool.</p></li><li><p>Surrender, fully, that you can’t control everything, or even as much as you pretend you can.</p></li><li><p>Say no more often than you say yes when someone asks something of you — say no to new projects, when you ask that of yourself, if you’re in the middle of enough already.</p></li><li><p>Say yes to the things that make the world a better place for everyone, not just the people you like and the people similar to you.</p></li><li><p>Spend time around people who are not like you. Go spend time with people of different backgrounds to you across race, class, gender, sexuality, ability, beliefs and ideals. Never become insulated from these experiences.</p></li><li><p>Your career is a vessel for your well-being — if your job isn’t making you happy and healthy and/or doesn’t quite meet the requirements you need to be happy and healthy, find support and transition to another path.</p></li><li><p>Having more money won’t make you more happy. It will give you more opportunity. Use it to become better, stronger, happier, and then to enable and inspire others to do the same.</p></li><li><p>Volunteer and give back. Always.</p></li><li><p>Playing video games, resting, visiting friends, watching movies — all the things you do to unwind are NOT A WASTE OF TIME. They combat burnout, and you need that time otherwise the things you make and the tasks you do will probably not be as good as if you were well-rested and inspired.</p></li><li><p>Take burnout seriously. Don’t pretend like it can’t and won’t happen to you.</p></li><li><p>Your emotions are important. Give them space, feel them, embrace them, and create from them — but do not let them rule you, and do not let them participate in decision-making. 90% of the time that is logic’s domain, and emotions often don’t compliment logical thinking well. You may read this and think, ‘But what about love?’ — a good question. A post for another time, though.</p></li></ol><p>When I write these things, know that I’m not preaching that this is the Absolute Path to Greatness or something as trite and presumptuous as that.</p><p>It’s just a list of things that I’ve been chewing on this past year, and we’re in that part of the year where self-reflection is imminent and plentiful. That’s all.</p><p>It’s the advice for myself I want to take. I don’t always follow my own advice, though, so sometimes I like to codify the things I’m thinking about so that I can point back and see where I went wrong, or right.</p>
