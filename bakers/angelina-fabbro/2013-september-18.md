# The Fear of Success

The last few pastries have tried to examine some common ways we tend to get in the way of ourselves when
trying to get better at programming. The last one examined procrastination, which is a common problem for a
lot of intelligent and creative individuals. In that post, I gave an example list I had constructed for myself
of all the ways and reasons I could possibly have for avoiding completion of a task. One of those items was
‘fear of success’, and I noted that particular item required some extrapolation.

In my experience, I have found a lot more written about the fear of failure than the fear of success. Does
this truly represent the proportion of people affected by either? Or could it be that fear of success is a
more controversial and perhaps less understood phenomenon? Could it be that as a culture we assume nobody
could be afraid of success and that failure is, instead, more important to address?

Once upon a time, years ago, I knew someone who never, ever finished a project. They had transferred three
times from university to university, always changing their degree plan short of actually ever completing a
degree. When confronted about this, the excuse was what you might expect: they had simply changed their mind
about what they wanted to do. With only a semester or two left in each case, at most a year of classes in one
instance, I found this hard to believe. Especially as this happened over and over. However, I gave this person
the benefit of the doubt.

Over the years I noticed similar patterns. Eventually, this person never finished any degree and instead moved
on to the idea of starting their own business. With another friend of mine, they cooked up an idea that had
the same fate as this person’s schooling, and after it, another. Each business idea would spool up, and then
before the product or service could really shine, this person always found some reason to shut it down and
move on. This was frustrating as I saw a lot of promise in some of the ideas and strategies; I could have seen
several of them become legitimate startups. Many of the ideas were niche and the ideas to accommodate them
were innovative. Still, they never followed through and I didn’t understand why. I didn’t understand why
someone so bright and creative would get so close to completion, so close to success and then just walk away
leaving only a paper-thin excuse behind.

I remember the day I thought to myself that they may be afraid of success. We were at my house and I was
listening to them hatch another plan with the same assurances and the same renewed vigour for it that came
with every new plan. I interrupted this person, which in retrospect I admit was rude, and I blurted out,

“You know, I really think you might be afraid to win. I think you’re afraid of being successful, and all
the responsibility that you’re not actually prepared for that might come with it. Every six months, every
year that passes you’re onto something new. Nothing ever gets finished. No risk is actually taken, and I
think it’s because you’re afraid of success more than you are of failing, because you had this pattern in
school close to graduation before you ever had it in business. You’re doing the same thing right now.”

Predictably, they did not respond well to this idea. Sometimes people are not very good at taking observations
others make in stride. Eventually, one day, this person did admit that perhaps that could be a part of why
they do what they do, but it was clear they didn’t want to talk about it very much out loud to another
person if that was true. I decided to respect that suspicion and let it be. Unfortunately, we do not keep in
touch anymore, for reasons that are unrelated to this encounter. However, I do know what this person’s doing
because the internet affords me the privilege of being able to keep up on old friends. 

For several years now this person’s been working on a web application, and in all that time it’s never
come out of beta. I’ve seen it, I’ve tried it, and what it definitely needs is actual non-beta users to
get any better. Nothing replaces user testing. Nothing replaces production-level mass-user testing on a site
you hope to reach a large audience with. I can’t help but suspect they know this, and that being in beta
forever is another manifestation of their fear of success.

Maybe you are afraid of releasing your code open source because you are afraid of having to maintain it,
especially if it gets popular. Maybe you are afraid that your code will be popular, and then attract a lot of
scrutiny. Maybe you are afraid of showing your boss how you optimized the entire order-taking system of your
business because then he’ll expect that same level of ingenuity and performance as a baseline and you
don’t think you can keep up consistently long-term. Maybe, just maybe, you’re afraid of success because
you don’t know what it looks like, and so maybe you’re afraid of the unknown. You might even have both a
fear of success and a fear of failure, which may make circumstances even more challenging.

At least, with failure, you can kind of guess at what failing will be like most of the time. You can say that
if you don’t complete a feature on time, you may get in trouble or even lose your job. If you don’t pass
an exam, you could fail a course in school. We spend a lot more time focusing on the consequences of failure
than on the consequences of success, and this is a problem.

When it comes to the fear of success, there is only one way to deal with it that I know of: take the risk. You
know you have something good but you don’t know what that will mean for you in the future, but if you
don’t take that chance then it may pass you by and the opportunity will be lost. Life is for living, and it
is all too short. If you don’t take the chance, you risk a life filled with regrets. You risk a life with
promise that was never shared with the rest of us, the world, and that is a sad thing. We want your greatness,
so bring it out, and I promise you’ll find others like you that will want to help you navigate whatever
comes next along the way. 

Yeah, sure — I don’t know what will come next for you any more than you do, but the same is true of any
day you live, and any path you choose since we cannot predict when your life may be over from circumstances
other than natural causes. Your projects are no different than a day in your life so to speak, so take the
plunge and see what happens. It’s worth the emotional risk.
