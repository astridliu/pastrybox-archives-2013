# The Code Doesn’t Care

One of my favourite things about programming is that the code doesn’t care who I am or what I do with
it.

The code is inert until I give it purpose. When I’m writing code, I’m in charge. What goes on is between
me, my compiler, and nobody else. 

Whatever you create in your development environment on your computer is private and yours alone until you make
it otherwise. Nobody else knows what you’re writing; this is between you and your compiler[*](#fn1), and all
the compiler cares about is whether or not the program runs. This is a tremendous sort of freedom.

Beyond that, the only accountability you have is to yourself in the early stages of writing a feature or
program. The only person there to judge what you write is you. Forget about what anybody else might think;
know that the code itself has no opinion of the matter and experiment to your heart’s content. Treat your
development environment as a playground when you’re just beginning something new. 

I have a lot of people asking me how to tell if their code is good when they’re just starting out with
programming for the first time. If you worry too early about whether or not your code is ‘good’ before you
even have something working, you’ll be wasting your time and sometimes you won’t even get to programming.
You’ll spin your wheels and doubt every line you write or don’t write and eventually you are beating
yourself up about code you haven’t even written yet. You’ll procrastinate while you worry about details
that don’t matter, and then you’ll wonder why programming is so hard. It’s not hard, but you’re doing
things in the wrong order. Your desire for goodness is healthy but the satisfaction of it must be delayed.

Get it up, then get it right.

When you’re just starting out—whether you’re learning to program for the first time, or maybe learning a
new trick for your trade—you should measure your success by only one criteria:

*Does the program do what I want it to for the end-user? (If you’re a beginner, then this is probably
yourself.)*

And that’s all. If you can answer this question with ‘yes’, then what you are making is good. Don’t
worry about what anyone else might think about your code. Don’t even worry about what you think of your code
yet. 

You don’t have to show what you’re making to anyone until you’re ready, if at all. Get it out dirty and
fast and messy if you need to, with passion and without remorse. Nobody has to see your first draft. A novel
is not written from beginning to end and then shipped to the publisher without being edited or revised. Code
is not written once and then deployed to the users without testing and iteration. Write something, anything,
and then come back to it; put your ego aside so that it’s just you and your creativity and your fingertips.
