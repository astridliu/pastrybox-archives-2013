Style is the most distinguishably unique aspect of a designer’s identity. While style can be defined as a
visual execution in a design, it can also be how a designer decides to execute. It is the most personal
attribute of being a designer, and while a style may differ depending on the context of the problem being
solved for, it is an essential quality that contributes to the evolution of a designer’s career. It is as
personal and unique as a singer’s voice.

While one could measure the success of a design, when it comes to emotion and innovation there is a lot to be
learned from Grohl’s statements about taste. As an industry the more we push agendas around style and taste
the more creativity we stunt. Find your own style as a designer and not only will you be happy, but you will
do your best work.
