I did Pixelworkers’ [Origin Story](http://www.unitedpixelworkers.com/pages/podcast) podcast a few days ago,
and it has me thinking. I get uneasy when I think back on how I got here. A smirking kind of uneasy, like
telling a bar story about a near-miss and changing the subject before you have time to consider how it might
have gone instead. I go over the “if”s once in a while just to reassure myself that they didn’t happen,
like touching a wall to help me keep my balance.

If entire generations didn’t live and die to give me a shot at a better life than a framing hammer and a
ruined spine.

If the friends I made at Wellesley hadn’t taken in some ratty kid sleeping in his car and taught him how to
put together a halfway-convincing “responsible adult” costume.

If not for friends handing me a couple of particularly fortunate gigs.

If I’d wavered; if I’d given up.

If I weren’t so goddamned lucky.

That one echoes. “If I weren’t so lucky.” Not as veiled self-congratulation for whatever successes or a
smug celebration of any particularly fortunate standing, but to keep me honest. I worked hard, sure, but where
would I be if my luck had been just a little worse at the wrong times? Not here. If I weren’t so goddamned
lucky, I don’t know where I’d be right now.
