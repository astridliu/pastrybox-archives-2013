The web is awesome. I don’t mean “awesome” in the Ninja-Turtle-parlance sense, either—I mean that the
web is something deserving of our awe; like the ocean, like space. Almost all of us are carrying—in our
*pockets*—a tiny sheet of glass that can access thousands of years’ worth of information on an
unimaginable range of subjects. Within a matter of minutes, any of us can know damn near anything. I hope that
never stops blowing my mind.

I’m constantly amazed by this thing we’re building together, and I consider it a genuine privilege to be
able to make a living doing something I care about. If I should ever become jaded about this stuff, I hope
that’ll be the same day I find myself a new career. Slowly, I assume, by way of newspaper ads and a red
Sharpie.

…They still make both of those, yeah?
