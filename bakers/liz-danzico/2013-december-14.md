# The perfect year

In 1979, I sucked up a crucifix. *Schlawapffk* is the sound it makes, FYI, when the special gift of a First
Communion necklace disappears into the head of a 1970 Electrolux Deluxe Automatic 1205 vacuum. 

It was an unassuming piece of jewelry, the kind that decorates not dictates Catholicism. Its delicate 14-karat
gold choker nearly invisible, letting the cross pendant do its thing.

But then it happened. In a moment of what I would like to remember as devout responsibility, but was in fact a
young me rocking out to a boombox while vacuuming my pink shag bedroom carpet, I knocked it off the dresser.
And in one fell swish of wand and nozzle, all was lost. 

It took me years to get up the courage to tell my parents about that necklace. What would they think of me if
they knew? Just like it took me years to tell them that our hamster didn’t just die a natural death, but
fell to her death one morning when I was trying to give her a hug before school. Et cetera.

What if they found out I wasn’t perfect? What if they knew I’d lost myself in music so deeply that I got
carried away? If they knew I’d loved an animal so immensely that I wanted to be close to her. What then?

And henceforth imperfect aversion began. Better if I kept these things, and all to myself. 

Imperfection protection is a training regimen that requires constant attention. Let your guard down (fall in
love, get lost, be in awe, get distracted) and your guard is down, susceptible to attack. Even after years of
practice, pruning, trimming, training, the armor is vulnerable. The typos slip through. The hem shows. The
human is. 

More years and many regimens later, I can confidently say I’ve lived the most imperfect year on record. 2013
was a year of loss and tragedy. But it was also a year of honesty. Of saying what is. And of owning up to not
being perfect.

Of course, much sooner than 2013, my family learned of the necklace, the hamster. What came of it wasn’t
nearly what I had expected, but instead support and a profound connection.

Like the things we intend to be, but never are quite that, the things we do, but never fall quite right, these
systems are ever in motion. And the key is not to focus on what is, but to be a participant in the exploration
of change. The what is in motion. To be present through transformation. Imperfection is a constant. Look and
listen for it, as it usually means you’re getting close.
