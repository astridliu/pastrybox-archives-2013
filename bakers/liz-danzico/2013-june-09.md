# On empty

Empty. Finished. I drag the pen point over the paper, and it tugs the surface with it. The pen, formerly of no
particular importance or consequence, is out of ink. Spent, it no longer translates gesture to paper. 

This, an ordinary event, doesn’t ordinarily turn heads. Yet this everyday ballpoint and I have made it,
together, for months. Through airport security and droning meetings, through bags and pockets. It’s
persisted. And, ultimately, triumphed as it has shown up here today, doing the last bit of what it was
intended to do. What it intended to do. 

How often do we see empty? Threadbare? Erosion? Patina? We subvert it — when we’re not intentionally
designing it — aiming to finish our products’ sentences and anticipate objects’ needs, replacing them
before they’re obsolete or worn.

There’s something to be said for showing up to finish what you started. Perhaps it’s a communication of
commitment, of consistency, of gratitude. But when two parties show up to start a job and finish, still
together, it’s rare. And beautiful. A perfectly dotted i. 

Full of empty.
