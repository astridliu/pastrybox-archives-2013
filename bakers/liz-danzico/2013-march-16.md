They were right. As they’d predicted two decades ago in 2013, half of humanity now lives in cities with
nearly 60 percent of our world’s population as urban dwellers. Cities have not only grown in size and
population, their very interface has changed.

Back then, citizens were enthusiastic about the layered effect of our data so we could search, sort, friend,
follow, retrieve, and archive it in the interest of exactitude. Google, Twitter, Foursquare were changing
technology—which is to say, culture. These, and more, increased the opportunity for specificity as they
decreased the chance for serendipity.

But humans grew uncomfortable. Things got smarter. Time sped up and time compressed as people became more
informed, more efficient, more connected, faster. While the rise of the slow (at first, slow food, then slow
web, slow cities) began as rhetoric, it took as a movement.

With more inhabitants than ever before, cities had become not a place for human interaction, but for precise
location and retrieval. Entering addresses and finding exact points on the map (with recommended
walk/drive/transit directions!) left little up to chance. As humans found more, they had less. Media inventors
of any notoriety launched apps and services that provided shortcuts: shortcuts to getting lost, shorthand for
privacy, short forms of disconnecting.

Meantime, undigital became luxury. Spas, once islands of tranquility and beauty, became islands of undigital
luxury goods. Free “off the grid service” services sold out. This pastoral new concord has had an effect.
Humans choose longer lines, the slow lane, practice inexact query formation. Because without the slow, the
good was not recognizable.

The divide between the connected and unconnected continues to demonstrate an economic discord: those living
comfortably are also living un-connectedly. Unubiquitious computing demands have inspired developers to rush
to build unconnected communities. The new *connected* is to be *disconnected*. Deadspots are the new
hotspots.

Moving toward is moving away, and hence, the notion of density and progress has changed. It’s our job to
pause, coordinate, and design opportunities for chance.
