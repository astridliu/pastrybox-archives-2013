       <p>We’re all faced with regular self-assessments of our professional skills. Whether it’s pondering putting yourself forward for that promotion, looking for new jobs, or deciding if you’re the right person to take that project on, we are conditioned into taking a list of requirements and mentally ticking boxes against each item. Who are you? What do you know? What don’t you know? Is this a match for you?</p><p>The list is extensive. Requirements, roles, and responsibility descriptions blend into buzzword bingo, with languages, frameworks, methodologies, libraries and systems flitting in and out of fashion accordingly. What do they want to hear? How honest should you be about your level of expertise? Can you tick that box? Do you know enough?</p><p>Of course, impostor syndrome is always there, sat on our shoulder as we tap away at our keyboards. You’ve been approached about an amazing opportunity, but you can’t do it. You listened to what they told you, and you’ve mentally ticked 75% of the boxes against it, but that leaves 25% where you’ll be shown up. That 25% will mean that you’ll be a failure. You’d love to learn more about those things, but can’t take the opportunity with no experience in those areas. You turn it down and do something easier instead.</p><p>We all enjoy feeling confident. We are hired for our expertise. We love it when our clients and our colleagues respect our knowledge and skills, and we can do our job well. We take the opportunities where we know our skills match 100% for this reason. “I’ve done all of that before; I know I can do it again.” But if we only pursue chances where we’ve already ticked all of the boxes, how will the others ever get filled?</p><p>Stop focusing on everything you already know, and focus on what you don’t know. Deliberately and proactively take work where you know there is a shortcoming, and use it as an incentive to improve. There are always a million reasons not to do something, and those tend to be what shout the loudest in our heads. Is that 25% a genuine reason not to take that opportunity, or is this a great chance to up-skill? Be honest with yourself and others, and let them be the judge of whether you can do the job. If it doesn’t work out, then hey, you still levelled up your XP from nothing to something — more than you’d have got from taking the work where you already knew everything.</p>
