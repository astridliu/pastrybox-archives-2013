I’m often asked “Do you need to be a *Jack of all trades* in the web industry?”

I believe there’s a place for two very different types of creatives within the industry (and I’d hasten to
include others such as graphic design, advertising, branding, and pretty much any company offering a service):


> Those who are passionate about an array of trades (let’s call them “The
> Jacks”), and those who are passionate about one very specific thing (“The Jills”).
> 

I’ve worked with some extremely talented people over the years, and they include both types — neither the
Jacks or Jills being more successful, nor more respected.

Mixing Jacks and Jills creates a winning team. 

One problem that I’ve seen many agencies (or studios) face however, is that they have a Jill overseeing or
running a project, or indeed the whole company. 

Who they really need in this role is a Jack. Someone who is wired to think about every area, the biggest
picture — not just the management itself for instance. 

By this, I don’t mean to pigeon-hole Jills into lower-level roles. A Jill is required at Director level too
— just *in their specific area* — a technical, or creative director for example. But the key here is to
make sure that there is always a Jack present.

So there you have it — a nursery rhyme for agency success.
