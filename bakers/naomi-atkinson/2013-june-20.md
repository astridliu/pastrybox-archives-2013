Today is a sad day. This morning I received a long, tearful email from a good friend telling me that her
husband has been diagnosed with Leukaemia. 

I instantly wrote back (understandably she wasn’t strong enough to talk), and as I was crying, pressing send
— there was a knock at my door.

My mum.

Intuition, following your gut, instinct, a sixth sense, telepathic tendencies, a genetic bond — however you
like to refer to it, my mum has *always* had it when it comes to me. 

Her explanation for turning up was simply “I got a sudden feeling about 10 minutes ago that you needed
me”. I of course was more than grateful to have a shoulder, hers especially, to cry on.

Earlier this year, I’d taken myself away for a weekend. I needed to think about some pretty difficult
decisions and required space to do it. I don’t believe I even told Mum when I was returning, but as I got
off the train she was there to meet me with flowers and my dinner for that evening. She simply asked
“What’s wrong darling?”. 

She stayed with me for the next few hours. I’ll never forget that. And she was right, I really did need
her.

All I want to share are two things:

 *  Follow your gut. Always.

 *  Never stop appreciating the people you love. Life is short.

Dedicated to my incredible and loving mum, Bernadette.
