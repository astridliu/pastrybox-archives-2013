       <p>Whenever I make the mistake of watching the news and politics and the evidential failure of the human species, I try to calm myself by thinking about the story of The Orphan Tomato. </p><p>It’s the story of my girlfriend and I picking up a few groceries at a supermarket on the way home. In the veggie corner she suddenly disagrees with my choice of tomato. Confused I double-check — the tomato I picked looks faultlessly succulent and fresh. It could have easily made it into a burger commercial.</p><p>My girlfriend comes over and out of the perfectly aligned army of identical red, juicy balls she picks up the single one tomato with dents all over its slightly saggy skin that’s riddled with signs of abuse. </p><p>“This one!”, she says as if it’s the most obvious thing in the world.</p><p>“Why?”, I ask still quite confused.</p><p>“Because if we don’t take her, no one else will. She’s gonna be left behind!”</p><hr /><p>Now, this may not be the most heroic story you’ve ever read, but in the face of all the unjust and pure evil shit that’s going down every day, to me the story of The Orphan Tomato represents all that’s still good in the world. </p><p>I may not be able to stop media companies from contaminating my mind, politicians from being corrupt and big corporations from destroying the planet, but with almost no effort I <em>can</em> stop the trend of not caring and I <em>can</em> stop my own cynicism about the world we live in. As cliché as it sounds, making this place better starts with the smallest, seemingly most insignificant things. Whether it’s giving up your seat for that old lady on the train, choosing to ride your bicycle instead of driving a car, or simply by not wasting perfectly fine food. </p><p>The little things, like an orphan tomato.</p>
