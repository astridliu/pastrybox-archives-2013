When I first started watching Seinfeld religiously in my early twenties, I was fascinated by how wonderfully
the show’s humour fits into our day-to-day lives, offering somewhat less serious solutions to somewhat
serious problems. One line that really struck me was during the episode “The Revenge” in which
George Costanza plots to exact revenge on his boss. Jerry sums up George’s struggle by saying:
“The best revenge is living well[*](#fn1).”

It’s almost too simple a solution to take seriously, but give it a second thought. The only way we can
be happy with our own lives and the decisions we make along the way is to go about it in a content,
unregretful way. Nothing teaches cynical or envious people a better lesson than seeing you not give a damn
about their actions. Being successful in your own life is the best way of getting back at them, and in turn,
inspire others to do the same.

[*](#r1) I later learned that Jerry borrowed this quote from the English poet [George
Herbert](http://www.infoplease.com/askeds/george-herbert-quote.html).
