I build user interfaces. This is my craft. As a UI engineer, I translate design into code. And I *deeply* care
about design.

While I’m implementing something, I see everything with technical eyes. It’s all about the code, nothing
else. Once things become functional enough, I step back. Does this actually feel good to use? Does it make
sense?

When building user interfaces, these are the two questions you should always be asking yourself:

 *  How will my code affect the user experience?

 *  How will the UI design affect my code?

The code shapes the design. And the design shapes the code. It should always go both ways: from inside out and
from outside in.
