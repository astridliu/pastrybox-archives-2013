Having written about my departure from the W3C last month, it seems only fitting to write about my return now.
I was elected to its Technical Architecture Group, as part of a [reform
campaign](http://infrequently.org/2012/12/reforming-the-w3c-tag/) driven by Alex Russell. Alex has great ideas
on improving modern day web development and I share his passion for figuring out how the web is layered and
how we can expose those layers for the world to do something wonderful with them.

In the beginning I had some misgivings about Alex, in particular the Web IDL bashing[[1]](#fn1). I understand
now that his concerns are with developers coming from a C/C++ background designing horrific JavaScript APIs.
And that DOM for someone from TC39 (designers of JavaScript) means Web-IDL-designed API, rather than
[DOM](http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/).

I was also pessimistic about this TAG adventure, and since five reform candidates were running for four slots
I was hoping I would not make the cut. But now I look forward to it. Taking a more high-level perspective with
a different set of people than I usually hang out with will be a great learning experience. And ideally that
leads to better standards writing down the road.

[[1]](#r1)To me Web IDL was the first real attempt to make it easier to define JavaScript-friendly APIs with
some enforced consistency with respect to argument handling. Its predecessor, aptly named OMG IDL, was
terrible in that respect.
