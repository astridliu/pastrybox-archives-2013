       <p>Having written about my departure from the W3C last month, it seems only fitting to write about my return now. I was elected to its Technical Architecture Group, as part of a <a href="http://infrequently.org/2012/12/reforming-the-w3c-tag/" title="Reforming the W3C TAG">reform campaign</a> driven by Alex Russell. Alex has great ideas on improving modern day web development and I share his passion for figuring out how the web is layered and how we can expose those layers for the world to do something wonderful with them.</p><p>In the beginning I had some misgivings about Alex, in particular the Web IDL bashing<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup>. I understand now that his concerns are with developers coming from a C/C++ background designing horrific JavaScript APIs. And that DOM for someone from TC39 (designers of JavaScript) means Web-IDL-designed API, rather than <a href="http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/">DOM</a>.</p><p>I was also pessimistic about this TAG adventure, and since five reform candidates were running for four slots I was hoping I would not make the cut. But now I look forward to it. Taking a more high-level perspective with a different set of people than I usually hang out with will be a great learning experience. And ideally that leads to better standards writing down the road.</p><p id="fn1" class="footnote"><a href="#r1">[1]</a>To me Web IDL was the first real attempt to make it easier to define JavaScript-friendly APIs with some enforced consistency with respect to argument handling. Its predecessor, aptly named OMG IDL, was terrible in that respect.</p>
