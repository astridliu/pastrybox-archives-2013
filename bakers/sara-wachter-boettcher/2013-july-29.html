       <p>“Stop being so sensitive.” </p><p>I wonder how many times someone’s said this sentence to me. If you’re a woman with opinions, you can probably relate. It’s an insidious little phrase so common it’s hard to keep track of how often it comes up. </p><p>Last week, I watched as yet <a href="http://storify.com/LeaVerou/the-sweet-and-gorgeous-tech-speaker-incident">another woman was accused</a> of being “too sensitive” and “overreacting.” Her crime? <a href="https://twitter.com/LeaVerou/status/360064880394506242">Responding with an eye roll</a> when a man <a href="https://twitter.com/DoerteDev/status/360061542819041280">commented on her appearance</a> rather than her presentation or her CSS skills.</p><p>I didn’t talk about this particular outburst when it happened, though. I was too busy.</p><p>I was visiting my mom.  </p><p>My mom’s a professor of chemistry at a big state school, but she didn’t start out there. She started out the second of five kids in a poor-ass family outside Munich, the daughter of an abusive artist living a childhood she still struggles to talk about.</p><p>She’s been told she’s “too sensitive” her whole life, too—by her dad, of course, and also by a whole parade of people in her 30-year STEM career—people who thought that her small requests, like asking to fix a building lock after multiple break-ins so she felt safe working alone on the weekends, were silly. <em>They</em> weren’t concerned, so <em>her</em> concerns must be irrational.  </p><p>“Stop being so sensitive.”</p><p>The problem with last week’s kerfuffle isn’t that some guy tweeted a compliment about a talented woman. He’s not a villain. He’s just a human being who thought another human being was gorgeous and failed to realize the underlying sexism involved with saying so in that context. When you live in a culture with a <em>lot</em> of underlying sexism, it’s bound to happen. Replying to his comment to let him know it was in poor taste isn’t overreacting, though. It’s simply reacting. That’s how conversation works. </p><p>The real problem is the same as my mother’s: the idea that because <em>other people</em> weren’t uncomfortable with the comment, <em>her</em> discomfort was irrational.</p><p>“Stop being so sensitive.” </p><p>This marginalizes the person who dares to speak up when they’re uncomfortable, and that’s bad enough. But it’s also bigger and more systemic than that. The more we tell people who are different from us that their needs and boundaries aren’t OK—and that they’re abnormal and irrational for having them—the narrower our community’s perception of normality becomes. </p><p>And that narrow viewpoint is something we carry everywhere, including right into our work. It leads us to more apps designed by and for the tech elite, more assumptions that everyone has access to the latest devices and endless bandwidth we enjoy, more misguided attempts at workplace “culture” resulting in what amounts to anti-diversity policies—because <a href="http://blog.prettylittlestatemachine.com/blog/2013/02/20/what-your-culture-really-says/">anyone who’s different just doesn’t “fit in.”</a> More confidence that our individual worldview is <em>the</em> worldview. </p><p>Want to design great things for <em>everyone</em>? Want to make websites and products and services that attract their entire potential audience? Want to end up with stronger ideas because they’ve been viewed and vetted through multiple lenses, not just ones that are the same as your own?</p><p>Then stop being so insensitive. </p>
