I felt myself nodding along at this post from a fellow content strategist the other day, cheering for her dive
into the depths of the details, her rejection of hundred-page “recommendations documents,” her inclusion
in every prototype.

There’s something beautiful about bringing a content focus into the heart of a design team—about getting
content strategists “out of the sidelines and onto the fields” of a project. Tussling with language and
labels and tasks and concepts allows us to wrap our arms around a problem, wrestle with it, and solve it.
Designers and developers hear new perspectives. The whole project is strengthened, and it’s extremely
satisfying.

But I couldn’t help but feel like there’s another half to this story about what makes content strategy
powerful—a half we don’t talk nearly enough about in our urge to get agile and ship and productize all the
things.

It’s not in what we do on any given project, though. It’s in our opportunity to immerse people from far
outside our project teams into this always-changing world of web-making.

## The “project” problem

As web professionals—not just content strategists, but designers, developers, IAs, what-have-yous—we tend
to work on *projects*. Whether we’re external agency types or internal web teams or consultants or pretty
much anything else, we parcel out our time and energy into tidy chunks: phases, launches, sprints,
versions.

When we do, we set up neat borders between our work and the rest of the organization’s day-to-day
operations. We think of *maintenance* and even *governance* as the proper upkeep of our project’s output: a
way to keep the product running smoothly. We assume that the control we have over the website during its
redesign is the way it will be controlled forever.

Only the web doesn’t really work that way. There’s always a messy middle between the project and the
organization—a silty confluence where the waters of one can’t help but merge with the other. The website
has to hook into a billion different backend systems. The customer service team uses the same help content as
the website. The departments need to contribute content that meets new formats. Products change, priorities
change, people in charge change.

The web is too big, too intertwined with anything and everything organizations do, to be neatly confined to a
project scope.

And when everything is online, suddenly everyone is a web worker, too—even, or perhaps *especially*, all
those nonspecialists whose crappy content we’re so busily trying to fix.

Yet we keep on trying.

## On making

I started working on the web seriously when I joined an agency in 2007. They didn’t think they were hiring a
content strategist, though. They thought they were hiring a web writer—someone to pretty up clients’
crappy old stuff and make it ready for the new (usually already designed and built) website. Someone to type
up neat little pages called About Us and Our Approach and the dreaded FAQ. Someone to (elegantly, of course)
cram a few keywords into the blurbs the “creative copywriters” had already produced.

It sounds silly now, this way of thinking about web content. Hell, it felt silly *then*, and it’s why I
started pushing for more: more thought going into content, more involvement in the early parts of projects,
more emphasis on *what we’re trying to say* and *what our users need*.

But you know what I did a lot of then? Making. I made words. I made sitemaps. I made *decisions*.

It was far from ideal, of course. Our research rarely included users; our design team wasn’t cohesive; our
process was less than collaborative. But the making—the getting-in-and-figuring-it-out part—still felt
powerful.

At least, it did at first. But every time we’d launch a site filled with some shiny new copy, I knew it was
only a matter of time before the friendly features would be replaced by a copy-and-pasted press release
announcing news no one cared about, before simple sentences would get run through the corporatese generator,
before the pages and pages of third-person, dead-to-the-world dullness would be tacked back up all over the
place.

It was only a matter of time before my work withered and wilted.

## On documenting

I never intended to make documents for a living. But I felt like I needed to do *something* to fill this gap
between the making and the sustaining.

So I started making deliverables. I wanted to give my clients and colleagues a way to understand and follow
along with the choices I’d made. Style guides, content models, templates, tip sheets: endless documents
designed to educate and prepare and encourage people to continue using the system I’d carefully planned out
for them.

I think a lot of content strategists feel the same: they started making documents as tools to explain their
work, and help others understand the implications of the choices they were making with content. *Here’s why
we are doing this, and here’s how you should keep doing it.*

The problem is, this line of thinking still only treats content as an *input*—the thing that goes on the
website, the thing that fills up our CMSes and our pages. And what it took me a long time to realize—to
articulate and understand and truly accept—is that content is also an *output*: the product of an
organization’s underlying culture, priorities, assumptions, and beliefs. The systems *I* was planning for
*them*—and the documents that came out of the process—weren’t doing enough to take that into
account.

Whether I was making or documenting, I realized I needed an approach to content that fit the cultures I was
working with. And the best way to make something fit a culture is to have it *come from that culture.*

Getting down and dirty with the design process may give us better inputs for our projects—a real and
valuable benefit. But alone, it will never change our organizations’ ongoing output. That takes a different
sort of labor—one that’s a lot less about us getting muddy on a playing field, and much more about asking
some unlikely others to join the team, too.

## Toward a parallel process

The thing is, we *do* need projects, those defined chunks of time and activity where *shit gets done.* We
can’t sit around eating deli sandwiches in conference rooms all day. We can’t try to solve every problem
and design for every platform with everyone in the room all at once. God, we’d all go nuts within a week.
Breaking things into stages or sprints or whatever works for your organization is necessary, and so is having
a defined team to work on those projects.

So lately I’ve been thinking a lot about how we can better juggle these two needs: the need to work on
content, closely and deeply, throughout the duration of a design project, *and* the need to empower all the
people who will make or break your project once it is out there in the wild to make good decisions and stay on
track.

I don’t have all the answers to this yet, but I do think the solution starts when we stop thinking of the
people who request and produce and update and approve content as outside of “our” web projects and teams,
and instead see them as just as critical to collaborate with as designers and developers.

This requires two parallel processes: one that’s all about keeping the project moving, and another that’s
all about shifting people and culture. Content strategists, at our best, are the bridge—the people who can
navigate both simultaneously, and reconnect them throughout the process.

For me, this has meant taking the questions I used to try to answer in documents, and asking my clients them
instead—often using hands-on activities that include people from as many departments and levels as possible:

 *  Where isn’t our content matching our mission? Why?

 *  What are its strengths?

 *  How could this be better organized?

 *  What content do our customers/readers need on their journeys?

 *  Do we have that content? What’s missing?

 *  Where and how should content be surfaced to support that?

 *  What’s keeping us from making content available at those times? How can we fix that? What structures
would enable that?

I used to think these questions were best left to the experts (a.k.a. me), but I don’t anymore. Because
I’m not the one who has to live with these decisions for the long term. The more I guide others as they
explore and debate and agree on answers, the more the strategy becomes not mine, but *theirs*.

It’s not always easy, of course, asking a workshop full of nonspecialists to agree on a core purpose or make
a content model or rewrite a page of copy in an hour. This isn’t their expertise, after all—it’s
mine.

But their version is often more powerful.

Because when strategy emerges from collaboration, it becomes shared knowledge. It becomes culture. It gives
our projects—those projects where we’ve worked so hard to roll up our sleeves and *make things*—a chance
to live on.
