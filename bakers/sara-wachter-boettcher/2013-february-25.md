People ask me all the time how they can get started in content strategy: *How do I convince my boss to let me
do more? How do I go beyond being a writer or a content manager? How do I wrap my head around content as
systems and sites get massive and messy?* 

Usually I end up tossing something out about asking tough questions and poking your nose where you don’t
belong until people start incorporating you in their projects. 

That’s not a lie, but it is a bit of a cop-out. Because I believe the real answer starts not in what you
*do*, but in how you *think*. 

The people who are best at strategic work—actually, scratch that, the people who are the best at practically
*anything* —share a common trait: the ability to hold big ideas and minute details together in their heads
at the same time—and to constantly, naturally, be vetting one against the other.

They can come up with a concept, then immediately find its weaknesses and figure out its feasibility. They can
look at a bevy of tiny details and see which of them are actually important to the big picture—and which
aren’t worth sweating. They understand that minutia like microcopy and QA matter, but they don’t
get stuck on them so long the rest of the project suffers. They’ll dream up a cool way to personalize an
experience, then immediately ask whether they have the data and logic to actually deliver it. 

I’ve seen too many projects fail because the people with the “big ideas” didn’t see it
as their job to care about the small stuff, too. And, just as detrimental, I’ve seen too many people
waste their time and skill sets by getting so hung up on formatting a laundry list of content recommendations
that they can’t see the bigger themes and opportunities. 

Vision is lovely, but vision alone doesn’t ship. It’s the people who can carry vision
through—and not just by handing off a plan or drawing a diagram, but by actually working through the
challenges of execution—who are most valuable. 

And boy could the world sure use more of them.
